Devil's Advocate is an [agent skill](https://skills.sh) compatible with **40+ AI coding agents** — including GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Roo Code, and more — that intercepts every plan, proposal, and action before execution and delivers a full adversarial risk analysis, blocking all operations until you explicitly authorize them.

It is not a linter. It is not a checklist. It is an adversarial analyst that:

- **Runs unconditionally first** — before any MCP tool, agent, skill, or file operation
- **Challenges every assumption** — finds what the plan missed, not what it got right
- **Fires alerts mid-sweep** — doesn't wait until the end to surface a Critical finding
- **Preserves your authority** — having permissions is not the same as having authorization

---

## Quick Install

```bash
npx skills add carrilloapps/devils-advocate
```

Or install globally (available in every project):

## What It Does

When you describe a plan, propose a change, or request any action, Devil's Advocate:

```
1. INTERCEPTS  — "Running Devil's Advocate before proceeding..."
                  Does NOT execute the action yet.
       │
       ▼
2. ANALYSES    — Loads relevant risk frameworks.
                  Fires ⚡ Immediate Report on first High/Critical finding.
                  Activates 🛑 Handbrake on any Critical finding.
       │
       ▼
3. REPORTS     — Full adversarial analysis: strengths, weaknesses,
                  assumptions challenged, edge cases, failure modes.
       │
       ▼
4. GATES       — Waits for your explicit decision before proceeding.
```

### The Gate (always at the end)

```
🔴 Devil's Advocate complete.

Before I proceed, please confirm:
  - [ ] I have reviewed all Critical and High issues above
  - [ ] I accept the risks marked as accepted (or they are mitigated)
  - [ ] I want to proceed with the approved action

Reply with:
  ✅ Proceed   — continue with the approved action as planned
  🔁 Revise    — describe the change and I will re-analyse
  ❌ Cancel    — stop, do not implement
  `continue`   — proceed without addressing remaining issues (risks remain active and unmitigated)
```

Nothing executes without your explicit `✅ Proceed`.

## Why This Exists

AI tools are increasingly capable of executing complex, multi-step operations — creating files, calling APIs, running migrations, deploying services. The default behavior is to help you accomplish what you asked for. Devil's Advocate adds the adversarial voice that asks: **"Should we?"**

The skill is designed on a simple principle: **having permissions is not the same as having authorization.** Technical capability never substitutes for your informed, explicit decision.

---

## Protocol Stack

The skill uses a layered protocol that escalates based on finding severity:

| Protocol | Trigger | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| ⚡ **Immediate Report** | First 🟠 High or 🔴 Critical finding | Flash alert mid-sweep + context request; analysis continues |
| 🛑 **Handbrake** | Any 🔴 Critical finding (or 3+ 🟠 High same domain) | Full stop + specialist escalation + focused pre-mortem |
| 📄 **Full Report** | After context received or `continue` | Structured adversarial analysis with all findings |
| 🚦 **Gate** | After full report | Waits for ✅ / 🔁 / ❌ before any action |

---

## Framework Coverage

| Domain | Framework | Role |
|--------|-----------|------|
| Architecture | `frameworks/architecture-risks.md` | Architect / Tech Lead |
| Security | `frameworks/security-stride.md` | Dev / Tech Lead |
| Performance | `frameworks/performance.md` | Dev / Tech Lead |
| Developer / Code | `frameworks/developer-risks.md` | Developer / Senior Engineer |
| Data & Analytics | `frameworks/data-analytics-risks.md` | Data Engineer / Analyst |
| Product | `frameworks/product-risks.md` | PM / PO |
| UX / Design | `frameworks/design-ux-risks.md` | UX / Designer |
| Strategy / Leadership | `frameworks/leadership-strategy-risks.md` | CTO / VP Eng |
| AI Optimization | `frameworks/ai-optimization.md` | All — AI context files |
| Version Control | `frameworks/version-control.md` | Dev / Tech Lead / DevOps |
| Vulnerability Patterns | `frameworks/vulnerability-patterns.md` | Dev / Tech Lead |
| General Analysis | `frameworks/analysis-framework.md` | All |
| **Building Protocol** | `frameworks/building-protocol.md` | Always active with code |
| **Output Format** | `frameworks/output-format.md` | All reports |
| **Handbrake Protocol** | `frameworks/handbrake-protocol.md` | Auto on 🔴 Critical |
| **Immediate Report** | `frameworks/immediate-report.md` | Auto on 🟠 High / 🔴 Critical |
| **Pre-mortem** | `frameworks/premortem.md` | Auto on 🔴 Critical (Handbrake Step 6) |
| **Handbrake Checklist** | `frameworks/handbrake-checklist.md` | Rapid Handbrake activation decision sweep |

**Context budget**: Load a maximum of 2 domain frameworks per analysis to avoid context window saturation. Protocol files (`output-format.md`, `handbrake-protocol.md`, `immediate-report.md`, `premortem.md`, `handbrake-checklist.md`) are free and do not count toward the budget.

## Building Protocol

When code is generated or reviewed, the **Building Protocol** activates unconditionally:

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Code identifiers** | ALL in `en_US` — variables, functions, classes, files, DB columns, endpoints |
| **Conversation** | AI responds in the user's natural language. Spanish prompt → Spanish response + `en_US` code |
| **Naming** | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` constants · `camelCase`/`snake_case` per language · `kebab-case` URLs |
| **Quality** | SOLID · DRY · KISS · YAGNI · functions ≤ 20 lines · ≤ 3 parameters |
| **Security** | No hardcoded secrets · validate all input · parameterized queries · least privilege |
| **Commits** | [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) · `en_US` · imperative mood |

See [`frameworks/building-protocol.md`](frameworks/building-protocol.md) for the full specification, violation severity table, and reference implementation.

## Automatic Trigger Detection

Devil's Advocate activates automatically — no invocation required — when it detects:

- Any plan or proposal ("I'm going to...", "The plan is to...", "We will...")
- Implementation intent ("Refactor X", "Migrate to Y", "Deploy Z")
- Architecture or vendor decisions
- Any action with side effects (create, edit, delete, run, deploy, call)
- Version control operations (force push, history rewrite, branch protection changes)
- Code reviews and PR analysis
- AI context file reviews (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, .windsurfrules, .clinerules, copilot-instructions.md, etc.)

> **Scope guard**: Only activates for plans involving code, systems, data, infrastructure, or technical architecture. Does not activate for purely conversational or social statements.
