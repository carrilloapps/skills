## Skill Details

### 🔴 [Devil's Advocate](skills/devils-advocate/)

> The mandatory adversarial analysis gate for 40+ AI coding agents — runs first, before any action.

AI tools are increasingly capable of executing complex, multi-step operations — creating files, calling APIs, running migrations, deploying services. Devil's Advocate adds the adversarial voice that asks: **"Should we?"**

**What it does:**

1. **Intercepts** every plan, proposal, or action — before executing
2. **Analyses** across 12 risk domains using specialized frameworks
3. **Fires alerts** mid-sweep on the first High or Critical finding
4. **Gates** all actions — nothing executes without your explicit `✅ Proceed`

**Protocol stack:**

| Protocol | Trigger | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| ⚡ Immediate Report | First 🟠 High or 🔴 Critical finding | Flash alert + context request mid-sweep |
| 🛑 Handbrake | Any 🔴 Critical finding | Full stop + specialist escalation |
| 📄 Full Report | After context or `continue` | Structured adversarial analysis |
| 🚦 Gate | After full report | Waits for ✅ / 🔁 / ❌ |

**12 domains covered:** Architecture · Security · Performance · Developer/Code · Data & Analytics · Product · UX/Design · Strategy · AI Optimization · Version Control · Vulnerability Patterns · General Analysis
