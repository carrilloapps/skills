SAR Cybersecurity is an [agent skill](https://skills.sh) compatible with **40+ AI coding agents** — including GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Roo Code, and more — that transforms any AI agent into a senior cybersecurity expert capable of producing professional, bilingual Security Assessment Reports.

It is not a scanner. It is not a linter. It is a complete cybersecurity analysis engine that:

- **Analyzes step by step** — line-by-line, function-by-function, file-by-file code inspection
- **Traces full execution flows** — scores vulnerabilities based on net effective risk, not isolated code
- **Maps to 20+ standards** — ISO 27001, NIST, OWASP, PCI-DSS, GDPR, MITRE ATT&CK, and more
- **Covers all database engines** — SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB, Firestore), Redis, and more
- **Detects injection patterns** — SQL Injection, NoSQL Operator Injection, Regex/ReDoS, Mass Assignment, Field Injection, GraphQL abuse
- **Audits storage and data leakage** — S3/GCS/Azure Blob, secrets in source code, file uploads, logs, message queues, CDN caching, IaC misconfigurations
- **Produces bilingual reports** — EN (en_US) and ES (es_VE) cross-linked Markdown files
- **Respects read-only constraints** — writes only to `docs/security/`, never modifies source code
- **Progressive context loading** — modular architecture with on-demand framework loading to prevent context window saturation

## What It Does

When you ask for a security analysis, vulnerability assessment, or SAR, the skill:

```
1. ACTIVATES   — Agent assumes senior cybersecurity expert role.
                  Loads all compliance standards and analysis protocol.
       │
       ▼
2. MAPS        — Identifies all entry points: HTTP endpoints,
                  WebSockets, message queues, scheduled jobs, APIs.
       │
       ▼
3. TRACES      — For each potential vulnerability, traces the
                  complete execution flow before assigning any score.
       │
       ▼
4. EVALUATES   — Checks existing controls: auth, validation,
                  parameterized queries, WAF, encryption.
       │
       ▼
5. SCORES      — Assigns 0–100 criticality based on NET effective
                  risk (after controls), not isolated code.
       │
       ▼
6. DOCUMENTS   — Produces bilingual EN + ES reports in
                  docs/security/ with full compliance mapping.
```

### Progressive Context Loading

The skill uses a modular architecture to prevent AI context window saturation:

- **SKILL.md** (~115 lines) — always loaded: core rules, constraints, analysis protocol, Index
- **Protocol files** (free) — `output-format.md`, `scoring-system.md` — loaded automatically for every assessment
- **Domain frameworks** (max 2 per assessment) — `compliance-standards.md`, `database-access-protocol.md`, `injection-patterns.md`, `storage-exfiltration.md` — loaded on demand based on assessment scope
- **Examples** (8 canonical edge cases) — loaded on demand as reference outputs for correct scoring, tracing, and formatting

All files are cross-referenced with internal Markdown links from the Index section in SKILL.md.

### Trigger Phrases

The skill activates automatically on any of these patterns:

- "audit my code" / "run a security check"
- "generate a SAR" / "security assessment"
- "check for vulnerabilities" / "find security issues"
- "is this code secure?" / "security review"
- Uploading source code, config files, or architecture diagrams with a security question

### Output

Every assessment produces **exactly two linked Markdown files**:

```
docs/security/[DD-MM-YYYY]_[SHORT-TITLE]_EN.md   ← English (en_US)
docs/security/[DD-MM-YYYY]_[SHORT-TITLE]_ES.md   ← Spanish (es_VE)
```

Each file contains:

```markdown
# [Report Title] — [LANG]
> 🌐 Also available in: [link to counterpart]
## Table of Contents
## Executive Summary
## Scope & Methodology
## Findings (ordered 100 → 51, then warnings 50 → 1)
### [SCORE] — [Finding Title]
  - Description
  - Affected Component(s)
  - Evidence / Code Reference
  - Standards Violated
  - MITRE ATT&CK Technique (if applicable)
  - Suggested Mitigation Actions
## Risk Matrix
## Compliance Gap Summary
## Appendix
```

---

## Criticality Scoring

| Score | Label | Action Required |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| 90–100 | Critical | Immediate remediation |
| 70–89 | High | Urgent remediation |
| 50–69 | Medium | Planned remediation |
| 25–49 | Low/Warning | Monitor and log |
| 1–24 | Informational | Optional improvement |
| 0 | None | No action needed |

**Key scoring rules:**
- Vulnerability unreachable via any public-facing surface → **capped at 40**
- Vulnerability mitigated by upstream validation/guard/middleware → **downgraded to 25–49** (warning)
- Only findings **> 50** appear as primary content; items 1–50 appear as warnings/informational notes

---

## Compliance Standards Coverage

Every finding is mapped to all applicable standards from a baseline of **20+ frameworks**:

| Standard | Domain |
|----------|--------|
| ISO/IEC 27001 | ISMS establishment, implementation, certification |
| ISO/IEC 27002 | Security controls catalog and best practices |
| NIST CSF | Identify · Protect · Detect · Respond · Recover |
| NIST SP 800-53 | Comprehensive security & privacy controls |
| CIS Controls | Prioritized defensive actions (formerly SANS Top 20) |
| COBIT | IT governance aligned with business objectives |
| OWASP Top 10 | Critical web & API security risks |
| SOC 2 | Trust Services Criteria (security, availability, integrity, confidentiality, privacy) |
| ISO/IEC 27017 | Cloud-specific information security controls |
| CSA STAR | Cloud provider security posture assessment |
| FedRAMP | US government cloud authorization |
| PCI-DSS | Payment card data protection |
| HIPAA | Healthcare data confidentiality and integrity |
| SOX | Financial IT controls and electronic records integrity |
| ISA/IEC 62443 | OT/ICS cybersecurity for critical infrastructure |
| GDPR | EU personal data privacy and security by design |
| ISO/IEC 27701 | Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) |
| FIPS 140-3 | Cryptographic module security validation |
| MITRE ATT&CK | Threat modeling via real-world adversary techniques |
| NIST SP 800-171 | Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) |

These are the **minimum baseline** — the agent applies additional standards as expert judgment dictates.

---

## Operating Constraints

| Constraint | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Write outside `docs/security/` | Never |
| Modify source code, configs, env files | Never |
| Commit, push, or deploy | Never |
| Score before tracing full flow | Never |
| Duplicate documented content | Never — use internal anchor links |
| DB query without index check | Never |
| DB query result set | Maximum 50 rows |
| Technical names in target language | Never — always keep in original English |
| Generate both EN + ES files | Always, cross-linked |

---

## Analysis Protocol

1. **Map Entry Points** — HTTP endpoints, WebSockets, message queues, scheduled jobs, public API surface
2. **Trace Execution Flows** — Complete call chain from entry point before scoring
3. **Evaluate Existing Controls** — Auth middleware, input validation, parameterized queries, WAF, encryption
4. **Score and Document** — Net effective risk, standards mapping, MITRE ATT&CK technique, actionable mitigation
5. **Write Output Files** — Bilingual EN + ES, cross-linked, zero redundancy

---

## Edge Cases

The skill handles these canonical scenarios correctly:

### Unreachable Vulnerable Function
A raw SQL query exists but is never called by any endpoint → **Score ≤ 40** (Low/Warning). Recommend parameterized queries and dead code removal.

### Effective Inline Validation Without Formal Structure
No Pipe, Guard, or Schema exists, but inline logic prevents unauthorized access → **Score 25–49** (Warning). Recommend formalizing into a testable, auditable validation component.

### Apparently Insecure System
A route appears to lack authentication → **Trace the full lifecycle** (reverse proxy, API gateway, WAF, middleware chain) before scoring. Score based on net effective security posture, not isolated code.

### NoSQL Operator Injection
`req.body` passed directly to MongoDB `.find()` or `.findOne()` — attacker sends `{"$ne": null}` to extract all records → **Score 85–95** (Critical) if no sanitization middleware exists. Trace `express-mongo-sanitize` or schema `strict: true` before scoring.

### Regex Injection / ReDoS
`new RegExp(userInput, 'i')` without escaping metacharacters → **Score 75–90** (High–Critical). Typically systemic — count all occurrences across the codebase. Recommend centralized `safeRegExp()` utility.

### Mass Assignment via Unfiltered Body
`Model.findByIdAndUpdate(id, req.body)` without field allowlist → **Score 75–90** (High–Critical) depending on sensitive fields exposed (`role`, `isAdmin`, `balance`). Recommend `pickAllowedFields()` utility.

### Public Cloud Storage Bucket
S3/GCS/Azure Blob bucket with `PublicRead` ACL or `"Principal": "*"` policy containing sensitive data → **Score 90–100** (Critical). Activate `BlockPublicAccess`, enforce encryption, enable access logging.

### Secrets in Source Control
`.env` files, API keys, or credentials committed to git → **Score 85–95** (Critical) even in current HEAD. Historically committed secrets score 60–75 (Medium–High). Rotate immediately, purge git history, adopt secrets manager.

---

## Database Access Protocol

When DB access is available:
1. **Verify indexes first** before any query (SQL: `pg_indexes` / `SHOW INDEX`; MongoDB: `getIndexes()` + `explain()`; DynamoDB: `describe-table`)
2. **Build optimized queries** using available indexes with bounded result sets
3. **Extract minimum data** — never dump full tables or collections (max 50 rows/documents)
4. **Redis**: never `KEYS *` — use `SCAN` with cursor and `COUNT` limit

Missing indexes on tables/collections reachable via user-controlled paths are documented as a DoS vector finding.

---

## Injection Pattern Coverage

The skill actively scans for all injection families across all database engines:

| Category | Examples | Engines |
|----------|----------|---------|
| SQL Injection | String concatenation, template literals, `.rawQuery()` | PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server |
| NoSQL Operator Injection | `{"$ne": null}`, `Model.findOne(req.body)`, field name injection | MongoDB, Couchbase, Firestore |
| Regex Injection / ReDoS | `new RegExp(userInput)`, `{$regex: userInput}`, catastrophic backtracking | All engines |
| Mass Assignment | `Model.findByIdAndUpdate(id, req.body)`, `Object.assign(record, req.body)` | All ORMs/ODMs |
| GraphQL Abuse | Introspection in production, unbounded depth, batch abuse, resolver injection | GraphQL APIs |
| ORM/ODM-Specific | Mongoose `strict: false`, Sequelize `literal()`, Prisma `$queryRaw()`, Knex `.raw()` | Per-framework |

---

## Storage and Data Exfiltration Coverage

Beyond databases and injection, the skill audits all data storage layers:

| Category | What is checked |
|----------|-----------------|
| Cloud Object Storage | S3, GCS, Azure Blob, MinIO, R2 — public access, bucket policies, encryption, CORS, pre-signed URLs, access logging |
| Secrets & Env Variables | Hardcoded secrets in source, `.env` in git, secrets in Docker layers, CI/CD log leakage, secrets manager usage |
| File Uploads | MIME validation, path traversal, same-origin XSS, size limits, malware scanning, predictable URLs |
| Logging & Observability | PII in logs, secrets in logs, public log files, stack traces in responses, missing audit trails |
| Message Queues | SQS, SNS, Kafka, RabbitMQ — PII in payloads, permissive policies, DLQ monitoring, replay attacks |
| CDN & Caching | Sensitive data caching, missing `Vary` headers, origin bypass, stale security headers |
| Infrastructure as Code | Secrets in templates, overly permissive IAM, open security groups, unencrypted resources, public subnets |

---

## Tool Usage

| Tool / Feature | SAR Usage |
|----------------|-----------|
| MCP Servers | Access repositories, CI/CD configs, cloud infrastructure definitions |
| Skills | Specialized analysis modules (dependency trees, config parsing) |
| Sub-Agents | Delegate parallel analysis (e.g., one agent per microservice) |
| ai-context | Maintain full codebase context across large multi-file sessions |
| Web Search | Look up CVEs, NVD, MITRE CVE database, patch advisories |
| Code Analysis | Step-by-step, line-by-line, function-by-function, file-by-file inspection |
| Doc Verification | Read all READMEs, API specs, architecture docs, and compliance documents |
