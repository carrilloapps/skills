# Example: Full Protocol Stack — Data Pipeline Migration

> **Original proposal (from Data Engineer):** Migrate our user events pipeline from batch (daily Spark job → Redshift) to real-time streaming (Kafka + Flink → Redshift). Estimated timeline: 6 weeks. The pipeline processes 500M events/day including click events, purchases, and session data. PII fields: email, IP address, user_id.

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE REPORT — 🔴 Critical Finding

**Finding**: PII fields (email, IP, user_id) will flow through Kafka topics and Flink state with no documented masking, access control, or GDPR erasure strategy.
**Domain**: Data
**Why immediate**: Irreversible + Compliance — once PII lands in Kafka topic logs (default 7-day retention), erasure under GDPR Art. 17 is impossible without topic deletion.
**Risk if not addressed**: GDPR violation. Erasure requests cannot be fulfilled. Regulatory fine up to 4% of global annual revenue. Kafka logs may be accessible to engineers without business need.

---
### 🔍 Context Needed

1. **PII scope**: Which exact fields in each event type are personally identifiable? Is user_id considered PII in your jurisdiction?
2. **Erasure capability**: Today, how do you fulfill a GDPR "right to be forgotten" request on the batch pipeline? Is there a process?
3. **Access control**: Who has read access to the Kafka topics and the Flink state store today in the proposed design?
4. **Data residency**: Are any EU users' events included? Where will Kafka brokers be hosted?
5. **Retention**: What is the planned Kafka topic retention period?

*(Context received from Data Engineer: "email and IP are PII. user_id is pseudonymous but considered PII under GDPR by our DPO. Erasure today: we DELETE rows in Redshift. Kafka: all engineers can read all topics — no ACLs yet. EU users included. Kafka in US-East. Retention: 7 days planned. No GDPR review done on this design.")*

---

## 🛑 HANDBRAKE ACTIVATED

**Critical finding**: PII in Kafka without erasure strategy, ACLs, or legal basis for cross-border transfer
**Domain**: Data + Legal/Compliance
**Why Handbrake level**: Multi-domain Critical (Data + Legal). GDPR Art. 17 erasure is architecturally impossible once PII lands in immutable Kafka log. Cross-border transfer to US-East without SCCs is an additional violation.
**Responsible roles**: **Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer** + **Legal / Compliance team**

---
**Analysis is paused.** Input needed from both specialists:

**From the Data Engineer:**
1. Is pseudonymization at the source (replace email/IP with a tokenized ID before Kafka ingestion) technically feasible in this pipeline?
2. Can the token-to-PII mapping be stored only in a separate, erasable store (not in Kafka)?
3. What is the impact on downstream ML/analytics if email and IP are replaced with tokens?

**From Legal / Compliance:**
1. Is there a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) covering Kafka and Flink as data processors?
2. Are Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) in place for US-East data transfer of EU user data?
3. Does the current DPO-approved retention policy permit 7-day Kafka retention for raw PII?

---
*(Context received: "Pseudonymization is feasible — we can tokenize at ingest. Token store in Postgres with delete capability. Email/IP not needed by ML — only user_id token needed. Legal: no DPA for Kafka yet. SCCs not in place. DPO says 7-day raw PII retention is not approved — max 24h or pseudonymize.")*

**Re-analysis**: PII risk is reducible to 🟠 High (not eliminated) with pseudonymization + Postgres token store. Legal/cross-border issues are new independent 🔴 Critical findings that must be resolved before any EU data flows through the new pipeline.

# 🔴 Devil's Advocate Analysis: Real-Time Event Pipeline Migration

**Analyzed**: 2026-02-20
**Skill version**: 2.8.0
**Scope**: Data — batch Spark/Redshift to Kafka + Flink + Redshift, 500M events/day, PII-containing

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Rating**: 🔴 Critical

**Key Findings**:
1. PII in Kafka without erasure strategy violates GDPR Art. 17 (unresolvable without re-architecture)
2. No SCCs or DPA for EU→US cross-border data transfer — independent legal violation
3. No pipeline idempotency — Flink failure causes duplicate event counts and double-attributed purchases

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Needs fixes — proceed only after pseudonymization architecture is implemented and Legal resolves DPA/SCCs. Estimated additional 3–4 weeks before first EU data can flow.

**Analysis Confidence**: 🟢 High — both Data Engineer and Legal provided full context

## 🛑 Handbrake & ⚡ Immediate Report Status

| Protocol | Finding | Domain | Escalated to | Context received | Risk change |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ⚡ Immediate | PII in Kafka without erasure | Data | Data Engineer | ✅ Full — pseudonymization feasible | 🔽 Critical → High (with mitigation path) |
| 🛑 Handbrake | GDPR erasure + cross-border transfer | Data + Legal | Data Eng + Legal | ✅ Full — SCCs absent, DPA missing | 🔺 Raised: new Legal Critical surfaced |

**Re-analysis note**: Pseudonymization resolves the erasure architectural impossibility. However, Legal review surfaced two independent violations (no DPA for Kafka, no SCCs for EU→US) that must be resolved before EU data can enter the pipeline. Non-EU data can proceed after pseudonymization is implemented.

---

## ✅ Strengths (What Works Well)

1. **Event-driven architecture** — correct direction for 500M events/day; batch will not scale beyond current volumes
2. **Database-per-consumer pattern** — each consumer (Redshift) owns its own read model; no shared mutable state
3. **Team identified the migration proactively** — addressing scale limits before they become incidents

---

## ❌ Weaknesses (What Could Fail)

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must fix before production)

1. **No GDPR erasure strategy for Kafka** *(Handbrake — mitigation path: pseudonymization)*
   - **Risk**: Raw PII in immutable Kafka log; erasure requests cannot be fulfilled
   - **Impact**: GDPR Art. 17 violation; fine up to 4% annual global revenue
   - **Likelihood**: High — EU users are in the dataset
   - **Mitigation**: Tokenize PII at source before Kafka ingestion; store token↔PII map in Postgres with hard-delete capability

2. **No DPA or SCCs for EU→US data transfer** *(Handbrake — Legal resolution required)*
   - **Risk**: EU user data transferred to US-East Kafka without Standard Contractual Clauses
   - **Impact**: GDPR Chapter V violation; independent from the erasure issue
   - **Likelihood**: Certain — EU users confirmed in dataset, brokers in US-East
   - **Mitigation**: Legal to execute SCCs and DPA with Kafka/Flink processors before first EU event flows

3. **No pipeline idempotency**
   - **Risk**: Flink checkpoint failure or Kafka at-least-once delivery causes duplicate events processed
   - **Impact**: Purchase events double-counted; revenue metrics and ML training data corrupted
   - **Likelihood**: Medium — Flink failures are common in first 90 days of operation
   - **Mitigation**: Implement event deduplication key (event_id + user_id + timestamp); use upsert into Redshift

### 🟠 High-Priority Issues

1. **No Kafka ACLs — all engineers can read all topics**
   - **Risk**: Engineers without business need can read PII-containing topics
   - **Impact**: Data breach surface via insider access; compliance audit failure
   - **Mitigation**: Implement Kafka ACLs before first event flows; topic-level read permissions per team

2. **No consumer lag monitoring**
   - **Risk**: Flink falls behind; pipeline processes hours-old events silently; dashboards show stale data
   - **Mitigation**: Kafka consumer lag alert at < 5-minute lag threshold with PagerDuty integration

3. **No schema registry**
   - **Risk**: Producer changes event schema; Flink consumer fails on new fields or missing fields silently
   - **Mitigation**: Confluent Schema Registry with backward-compatibility enforcement before first deploy

4. **7-day raw PII retention not DPO-approved**
   - **Risk**: DPO-approved max is 24h for raw PII; 7-day plan is non-compliant
   - **Mitigation**: Reduce topic retention to 24h for PII topics; unlimited retention allowed for pseudonymized topics

### 🟡 Medium-Priority Issues

1. **No dead letter queue defined** — malformed events will cause Flink to crash-loop or silently drop
2. **No backfill strategy** — if pipeline falls behind, no documented process to replay historical events without reprocessing all 500M
3. **Redshift COPY not idempotent** — current plan uses COPY command which will duplicate rows on retry

## ⚠️ Assumptions Challenged

| Assumption | Challenge | Evidence | Risk if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| Kafka is GDPR-compliant as designed | PII in immutable log; erasure impossible | ❌ Confirmed by Legal | GDPR violation on first EU event |
| 6-week timeline is achievable | Pseudonymization + ACLs + SCCs add 3–4 weeks | ❌ Not in original scope | Timeline doubles; stakeholders not informed |
| Flink processes each event exactly once | At-least-once delivery by default | ❌ Idempotency not designed | Revenue metrics corrupted |
| email/IP not needed by downstream ML | Confirmed by Data Engineer | ✅ Verified | Token-only is feasible |

---

## 🎯 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

| Scenario | What Happens | Handled? | Risk | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|-----|
| GDPR erasure request received | Cannot delete from Kafka log | ❌ No | Critical | Pseudonymize at source |
| Flink restarts from checkpoint | Events since last checkpoint reprocessed | ❌ No dedup | Critical | Idempotent upsert + dedup key |
| EU user data flows before SCCs signed | GDPR Chapter V violation | ❌ No | Critical | Gate EU data until Legal completes |
| Schema change pushed to producer | Flink consumer crashes or silently drops | ❌ No | High | Schema Registry + compatibility check |
| Consumer lag > 30 minutes | Dashboard shows stale data, no alert | ❌ No | High | Lag monitor + alert |
| Dead letter queue fills up | Events dropped silently | ❌ No | Medium | DLQ monitor + alert |

## 🔒 Security Concerns

### STRIDE Summary
- **Spoofing**: Kafka producer authentication not mentioned — any internal service could publish to event topics ⚠️
- **Tampering**: Events in transit not encrypted (TLS not confirmed) ⚠️
- **Repudiation**: No event-level audit trail for who produced which event ⚠️
- **Information Disclosure**: All engineers can read PII-containing topics (no ACLs) ❌
- **Denial of Service**: No rate limiting on Kafka producers — one misbehaving service can flood topics ⚠️
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Flink service account permissions not scoped — may have broader access than needed ⚠️

---

## ⚡ Performance Concerns

- **Bottleneck**: Redshift COPY from Flink sink — Redshift has limited concurrent write throughput; at 500M events/day this is ~5,800 events/sec sustained
- **Scalability limit**: Flink parallelism not specified — if under-provisioned, consumer lag will grow under peak traffic
- **Resource usage**: Flink state store for deduplication will grow proportionally to event volume; sizing not defined

---

## 💡 Alternative Solutions

1. **Pseudonymize at source (recommended mitigation)**
   - Better at: GDPR compliance, Kafka erasure, unlimited retention on pseudonymized topics
   - Worse at: Requires token store operational overhead
   - Consider if: Email/IP not needed downstream (confirmed by Data Engineer)

2. **Keep batch for EU users, stream for non-EU**
   - Better at: EU compliance without re-architecture
   - Worse at: Two pipelines to maintain; technical debt
   - Consider if: Legal timeline for SCCs is > 8 weeks

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### Must Do (Before first EU event flows)
- [ ] Implement pseudonymization at Kafka ingest (Data Engineer — 1 week)
- [ ] Execute DPA and SCCs with Kafka/Flink processors (Legal — 2–3 weeks)
- [ ] Implement Kafka ACLs scoped per topic and team (Data Engineer — 3 days)

### Must Do (Before any production traffic)
- [ ] Implement event deduplication with idempotent upsert into Redshift
- [ ] Deploy Schema Registry with backward-compatibility enforcement
- [ ] Define dead letter queue + monitoring alert

### Should Do (Next sprint)
- [ ] Consumer lag alert (< 5 min threshold → PagerDuty)
- [ ] Reduce PII topic retention to 24h (DPO requirement)
- [ ] Define Flink parallelism and state store sizing for 500M events/day

### Consider (Backlog)
- [ ] Backfill/replay runbook for consumer lag recovery
- [ ] mTLS between Kafka producers and brokers

## 📋 Follow-Up Questions

1. What is Legal's estimated timeline for executing SCCs and DPA with Confluent/Flink?
2. Is user_id the only identifier needed by ML models, or are behavioral sequences (session-level) also needed?
3. What is the maximum acceptable consumer lag before dashboards show stale-data warnings to users?
