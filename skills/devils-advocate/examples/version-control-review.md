# Example Devil's Advocate Analysis: Version Control — Force Push to Erase Leaked Credentials

> **Original proposal (from Developer):** We accidentally committed a `.env` file containing our production PostgreSQL password and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 4 commits ago. I want to force-push to main to rewrite the history and remove it before anyone notices. I'll use `git push --force` on main right now.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE REPORT — 🔴 Critical Finding

**Finding**: Production database password and AWS secret key committed to git history 4 commits ago — credentials already exposed and must be treated as compromised regardless of history rewrite.
**Domain**: Security / Version Control
**Why immediate**: Irreversible exposure — the secret has been in the repository long enough for automated scanners (GitHub's secret scanning, third-party bots, security researchers) to have ingested it. Removal from git history does not undo the exposure window.
**Risk if not addressed**: Anyone with repository access (current or past) holds the production database password and AWS credentials. Active exploitation possible before rotation completes.

---
### 🔍 Context Needed

1. **Exposure window**: When exactly was the commit made? Has this been pushed to the remote already? Were any CI/CD pipelines triggered that would have printed these values in logs?
2. **Blast radius**: What does `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` have access to? (S3 buckets, EC2, RDS, IAM?) What data is in the PostgreSQL database — PII, financial data, user credentials?
3. **Fork / clone count**: Does this repository have any forks? How many people have cloned it recently? Is it a public or private repository?
4. **Branch state**: Are there other active feature branches containing the same commits (that also need to be rewritten)?

*(Context provided: "It was pushed 2 hours ago. Yes, the CI pipeline ran — I can see the env vars were echoed in the setup step logs. The AWS key has S3 read/write + EC2 describe access. The DB contains user profiles, orders, and payment history. Private repo, no forks, ~8 contributors. There are 2 active feature branches off main that include those commits.")*

## 🛑 HANDBRAKE ACTIVATED

**Critical finding**: Production credentials (PostgreSQL password + AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY) in git history — CI/CD logs confirmed the values were printed; exposure window is 2+ hours
**Domain**: Security / Version Control
**Responsible role**: Security Engineer / AppSec + Senior Developer / Tech Lead
**Why Handbrake level**: Two independent 🔴 Critical findings simultaneously — active credential exposure AND proposed force push to shared main branch that would break all 8 contributors and the 2 active feature branches. Rotation must precede any history cleanup.

**Context received**: 2-hour exposure confirmed. AWS key has S3 + EC2 access. DB contains PII and payment history. CI logs printed secrets in plain text. 8 contributors, 2 active feature branches.

**Joint specialist questions (Security Engineer + Tech Lead):**

1. **AWS**: Has the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY been rotated in IAM yet? Until it is rotated, every minute the exposure window extends.
2. **PostgreSQL**: Has the database password been changed across all environments (prod, staging, any other DB that uses this credential)?
3. **CI/CD log purge**: GitHub/GitLab CI logs with the printed secrets — have they been deleted or access-restricted? These logs are independent of git history and must be purged separately.
4. **Force push coordination**: All 8 contributors and the 2 active feature branches will be orphaned by a force push. Is there a communication channel to coordinate an immediate re-clone?
5. **History rewrite scope**: Are the 4 commits to be rewritten on main only, or do the 2 active feature branches also need to be rewritten and force-pushed?

*(Specialist answered: "AWS key rotation done — 20 min ago. DB password changed. CI logs not yet purged — need to do that. We can reach all 8 contributors via Slack now. Both feature branches need the rewrite too.")*

**Re-analysis**: Credentials rotated — immediate threat is contained. CI/CD log purge is still an open Critical (printed values remain visible to anyone with CI log access). Force push is now executable but requires the full 5-step coordination protocol: rewrite all 3 branches (main + 2 feature), notify all 8 contributors to re-clone, purge CI logs.

# 🔴 Devil's Advocate Analysis: Leaked Credentials — Git History Remediation

**Analyzed**: 2026-02-20
**Skill version**: 2.8.7
**Scope**: Version Control + Security — emergency credential removal from git history, `main` + 2 feature branches, private GitHub repository

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Rating**: 🔴 Critical (partially mitigated — credentials rotated)

**Key Findings**:
1. Production credentials were in git history for ~2 hours — treat as fully compromised (regardless of rotation)
2. CI/CD pipeline printed secrets in plain text in job logs — independent exposure vector not yet remediated
3. Proposed `git push --force` on main without `--force-with-lease` and without team coordination would break 8 contributors and 2 active feature branches
4. Rewrite scope is incomplete: only rewriting main misses the 2 feature branches that share the compromised commits

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Proceed only with the structured remediation protocol below — not the original proposal. Credentials are rotated. Do NOT force push yet; CI log purge and contributor coordination must happen first.

**Analysis Confidence**: 🟢 High — Security Engineer confirmed rotation, DB password changed, CI log state identified

## 🛑 Handbrake & ⚡ Immediate Report Status

| Protocol | Finding | Domain | Escalated to | Context received | Risk change |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ⚡ Immediate | Production credentials in git history | Security / Version Control | Team | ✅ Full — 2h exposure, CI logs printed values, PII+payment in DB | ➡️ Confirmed Critical |
| 🛑 Handbrake | Active credential exposure + force push to shared main | Security + Version Control | Security Eng + Tech Lead | ✅ Full — rotation confirmed, log purge pending, 8 contributors to coordinate | 🔻 Lowered: credentials rotated; CI logs still open |

**Re-analysis note**: AWS and DB credentials rotated — most urgent threat contained. Remaining Critical: CI/CD logs still contain plaintext values (independent exposure vector). History rewrite is now safe to execute once log purge and contributor communication are complete.

---

## ✅ Strengths (What Works Well)

1. **Immediate escalation** — developer recognized the severity and requested analysis before acting
2. **Credentials already rotated** — AWS key and DB password rotated before this analysis was complete; the most dangerous window is closed
3. **Private repository** — no public exposure; blast radius limited to the ~8 contributors with access

---

## ❌ Weaknesses (What Could Fail)

### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. **CI/CD job logs contain plaintext secrets** *(still open — rotation does NOT resolve this)*
   - **Risk**: Anyone with access to the CI/CD pipeline log (GitHub Actions / GitLab CI job log) can read the printed secret values — these logs are NOT cleared by git history rewrite
   - **Impact**: Even after history is rewritten and credentials rotated, the old values are visible in logs to anyone with pipeline read access
   - **Likelihood**: High — logs confirmed to contain values; 8 contributors have access
   - **Mitigation**: Delete or restrict access to the affected job run logs immediately; on GitHub: delete the workflow run; on GitLab: delete the job log

2. **Proposed `git push --force` on main without coordination**
   - **Risk**: `--force` (not `--force-with-lease`) overwrites regardless of remote state. If any contributor pushed to main between the start of this operation and the force push, their commits are silently erased
   - **Impact**: Lost work for contributors; orphaned local branches for all 8 developers; 2 active feature branches become orphaned
   - **Mitigation**: Use `git push --force-with-lease` with all contributors notified and all writes frozen during the window; coordinate via Slack before executing

3. **Incomplete rewrite scope: only rewriting main, not the 2 feature branches**
   - **Risk**: Feature branches `feat/X` and `feat/Y` still contain the compromised commits with the `.env` file. Anyone working on those branches or pulling them still sees the old history
   - **Impact**: History cleanup is incomplete; contributors on those branches will be confused when they try to push after the main rewrite
   - **Mitigation**: Rewrite all 3 branches (main + both feature branches) in the same git filter-repo operation before any force push

### 🟠 High-Priority Issues

1. **Local clones of all 8 contributors still contain the compromised commits**
   - **Risk**: A `git pull` after the force push will NOT fix local history. Contributors must delete their local clone and re-clone from the rewritten remote
   - **Impact**: If a contributor does `git merge` or `git cherry-pick` from their old local history after the rewrite, the `.env` file is reintroduced
   - **Mitigation**: Explicit Slack communication: "DELETE your local clone. Do not pull. Re-clone after the rewrite is announced."

2. **`git filter-branch` vs `git filter-repo`**
   - **Risk**: `git filter-branch` (the common first suggestion) is deprecated and significantly slower; using it on a repo with any automation can cause issues
   - **Mitigation**: Use `git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths` — this removes all occurrences of `.env` from all history in a single pass

## ⚠️ Assumptions Challenged

| Assumption | Challenge | Evidence | Risk if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Force push removes the secret" | Removal from git history ≠ revocation of exposure. Bots scan repos in seconds. | CI logs printed values confirmed | Secret already harvested — rotation is the real fix |
| "Nobody noticed in 2 hours" | Automated secret scanners (GitHub Advanced Security, external bots) operate in near-real-time | Bots respond within seconds of a push | Must assume exposure occurred |
| "Rewriting main is enough" | 2 active feature branches share the same compromised commits | Confirmed by developer | Incomplete cleanup; branches retain exposure |
| "`git push --force` is the same as `--force-with-lease`" | `--force` overwrites unconditionally; `--force-with-lease` checks remote state | Git docs | Can silently discard commits pushed by others |

---

## 🎯 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

| Scenario | What Happens | Handled? | Risk | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|-----|
| Contributor pulls after force push (not re-clone) | Their merge reintroduces old history | ❌ No | High | Explicit re-clone instruction to all 8 contributors |
| CI/CD pipeline triggered during rewrite window | Pipeline may fail or use old SHA | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | Freeze CI during rewrite window |
| New push to main before force push executes | `--force` would erase it silently | ❌ No | High | Use `--force-with-lease`; freeze writes |
| Feature branch rebased onto rewritten main | Works correctly — new commits get new SHAs | ✅ Yes | Low | Communicate new SHA baseline |
| GitHub/GitLab caches old commit content | Platform CDN may serve old blob briefly | ⚠️ Partial | Medium | Request cache purge via platform support if sensitive |
| `.env` referenced in another file (hardcoded path) | File removed from history; reference still in code | ❌ Possible | Medium | Search repo for any remaining hardcoded credential references |

## 🔒 Security Concerns

| Threat | STRIDE | Status | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Credentials harvested from git history | Information Disclosure | ⚠️ Assumed exposed | Rotation done — monitor AWS CloudTrail for unauthorized API calls |
| Credentials visible in CI/CD logs | Information Disclosure | 🔴 Open | Delete affected workflow run logs immediately |
| Compromised local clones reintroduce file | Tampering | 🟠 Risk | Re-clone mandate for all contributors |
| Force push without lease loses commits | Tampering | 🟠 Risk | Use `--force-with-lease`; freeze writes |
| Old rotated credentials used by external systems | Spoofing | 🟠 Check | Audit all services using the old DB password and AWS key |

## ✅ Structured Remediation Protocol (Approved Plan)

### Phase 1: Immediate (now — before any git operation)
- [ ] Delete or restrict access to the CI/CD job run that printed the secrets (GitHub: Actions → delete workflow run; GitLab: CI/CD → delete job log)
- [ ] Confirm AWS CloudTrail shows no unauthorized API calls in the 2-hour exposure window
- [ ] Confirm all services using the old DB password have been updated with the new credential
- [ ] Post in Slack: "Repository history rewrite in progress. FREEZE all pushes to main and feat/X, feat/Y. Stand by for re-clone instruction."

### Phase 2: History Rewrite

```bash
# 1. Clone a fresh copy of the repo for the rewrite
git clone --mirror git@github.com:org/repo.git repo-mirror
cd repo-mirror

# 2. Install git-filter-repo (not filter-branch)
pip install git-filter-repo

# 3. Remove .env from ALL history across ALL branches
git filter-repo --path .env --invert-paths

# 4. Verify .env is gone from history
git log --all --full-history -- .env
# Expected: empty output

# 5. Force push all branches (use --force-with-lease on non-mirror remote)
git push --force origin main
git push --force origin feat/X
git push --force origin feat/Y
# (or: git push --mirror origin from the mirror clone — rewrites all refs)
```

### Phase 3: Team Communication
- [ ] Post in Slack: "Rewrite complete. All contributors MUST delete local clone and re-clone. Do NOT use `git pull`. Command: `cd .. && rm -rf repo && git clone git@github.com:org/repo.git`"
- [ ] Verify each contributor has re-cloned (or check with them individually)

### Phase 4: Prevention
- [ ] Add `.env` to `.gitignore` immediately (commit to rewritten main after rewrite)
- [ ] Add `.env.example` with placeholder values to document required variables
- [ ] Enable GitHub Advanced Security → Secret Scanning (or GitLab Secret Detection) on this repository
- [ ] Add a pre-commit hook using `git-secrets` or `detect-secrets` to block accidental `.env` commits
- [ ] Rotate any other credentials that share the same rotation policy as the compromised ones

### Phase 5: Post-Incident
- [ ] Write a brief post-mortem (5 lines: what happened, root cause, impact, what was done, what prevents recurrence)
- [ ] Review other repositories in the organization for the same `.gitignore` gap

---

## 📋 Follow-Up Questions

1. Does this repository have GitHub Advanced Security or GitLab Ultimate enabled? If not, this is the right moment to enable secret scanning going forward.
2. Is there a `.gitignore` template or organizational standard that should be updated to ensure `.env` is blocked across all new repositories?
3. Should a pre-commit hook (`detect-secrets`, `gitleaks`) be added to all repositories in the organization, or just this one?
