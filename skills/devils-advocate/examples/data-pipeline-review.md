# Example Devil's Advocate Analysis: Data Pipeline — Customer Analytics Migration to BigQuery

> ⚠️ **EDUCATIONAL EXAMPLE — NOT FOR IMPLEMENTATION.** This file contains a fictional data migration plan with deliberately missing privacy controls, used solely to demonstrate how Devil's Advocate detects GDPR, PII, and data governance risks. All company names, infrastructure details, and data flows are fictional.

> 🔍 **Adversarial analysis example.** The proposal below is intentionally flawed — it migrates PII without masking, access controls, or a GDPR compliance plan. This file demonstrates how Devil's Advocate activates the Handbrake protocol on data protection gaps.

> **Original proposal (from Data Engineer):**Migrate our customer behavior analytics pipeline from MySQL to BigQuery. The pipeline processes 2M events/day including click streams, purchase history, and support ticket content. Timeline: 2 weeks. Plan: extract full MySQL tables to GCS, load into BigQuery, point dashboards at BigQuery, decommission MySQL tables. No masking or access control changes planned — "we'll handle governance later."

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE REPORT — 🟠 High Finding

**Finding**: Customer PII (names, emails, purchase history, support ticket content) will be loaded into BigQuery without data masking, access controls, or a governance plan — "handle governance later" is not a valid compliance posture for a production PII migration.
**Domain**: Data
**Why immediate**: Any engineer or analyst with BigQuery project access will have unmasked PII accessible immediately after load — before the "governance later" work is ever done. In practice, "later" governance work often never ships.
**Risk if not addressed**: GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design) violation; CCPA data minimization exposure; PII accessible to everyone with GCP project access; no audit trail; no ability to honor GDPR Art. 17 erasure requests against BigQuery.

---
### 🔍 Context Needed

1. **PII inventory**: Which specific fields are personally identifiable? Names, emails, IP addresses, free-text support tickets? Is any of this health, financial, or special-category data?
2. **Access scope**: How many people have BigQuery project access today? What IAM roles are assigned?
3. **Regulatory jurisdiction**: Do we serve EU or California customers? Are GDPR or CCPA obligations in scope?
4. **Erasure path**: If a user submits a GDPR Art. 17 "right to be forgotten" request today, how is their data removed from BigQuery event tables?

*(Context provided: "PII includes email, full name, IP, support ticket text (free text, may contain sensitive info). 12 engineers + 8 analysts = 20 people with project-level access today. Yes, EU customers — GDPR in scope. CCPA also applies. No erasure path exists for BigQuery.")*

---

## 🛑 HANDBRAKE ACTIVATED

**Critical finding**: 20 people will have unmasked access to EU/CCPA customer PII in BigQuery with no erasure path — GDPR Article 25 (data protection by design) and Art. 17 (right to erasure) cannot be satisfied with this plan
**Domain**: Data
**Responsible role**: Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer + Legal / Compliance
**Why Handbrake level**: GDPR Art. 25 requires that privacy-protecting controls are built in from the start — not added later. Loading PII into an uncontrolled BigQuery project with 20 people's access creates an immediate compliance gap that starts the moment of load. The "later" plan does not satisfy the regulation.

**Specialist questions for Data Engineer / Analytics Engineer:**

1. Is there a column-level security or data masking capability in BigQuery that can be applied at load time (BigQuery Column-Level Security + Policy Tags)?
2. What is the minimum set of fields that each consumer (analysts vs. engineers) actually needs — can we implement row-level and column-level access controls before migration?
3. What is the plan for honoring GDPR Art. 17 erasure requests in BigQuery event tables — partitioned deletion, manual deletion, or a separate pseudonymization table?
4. Has a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) been signed with Google Cloud for EU data?

*(Data Engineer answered: "BigQuery Policy Tags can mask columns. Analysts need email for cohort analysis but not for dashboards. No DPA confirmed — need to check. We can partition by user_id and delete partitions for erasure.")*

# 🟠 Devil's Advocate Analysis: Customer Analytics Pipeline to BigQuery

**Analyzed**: 2026-02-20
**Skill version**: 2.8.8
**Scope**: Data — BigQuery migration for 2M events/day with customer PII; GDPR + CCPA in scope

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Overall Risk Rating**: 🟠 High (elevated from plan; not Critical because masking is technically feasible and a remediation path exists)

**Key Findings**:
1. PII will land in BigQuery with 20-person access and no masking — GDPR Art. 25 violation if shipped as proposed
2. No GDPR Art. 17 erasure path for BigQuery event tables — currently unresolvable without partitioning strategy
3. DPA with Google Cloud (GCP) for EU data processing not confirmed
4. Free-text support ticket content may contain special-category data (health, financial) not inventoried

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Revise before migration — the technical path exists (BigQuery Policy Tags, partitioned erasure, IAM scoping) but must be implemented as part of the migration, not after.

**Analysis Confidence**: 🟢 High — Data Engineer confirmed masking approach; Legal input on DPA still needed

## 🛑 Handbrake & ⚡ Immediate Report Status

| Protocol | Finding | Domain | Escalated to | Context received | Risk change |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ⚡ Immediate | PII in BigQuery without masking or access controls | Data | Team | ✅ Full — 20 people's access confirmed, EU + CCPA in scope | ➡️ Confirmed High |
| 🛑 Handbrake | GDPR Art. 25 + Art. 17 gap — no erasure path | Data | Data Engineer + Legal | ✅ Partial — masking approach confirmed; DPA status unknown | 🔻 Lowered to High: remediation path identified |

---

## ✅ Strengths (What Works Well)

1. **BigQuery is the right tool** — the scale (2M events/day) will strain MySQL; BigQuery's columnar storage and cost model are appropriate
2. **2-week timeline is realistic** for the technical migration alone
3. **Partitioned tables by user_id** — the engineer's proposed partitioning strategy enables the erasure path needed for GDPR

---

## ❌ Weaknesses (What Could Fail)

### 🟠 High-Priority Issues

1. **GDPR Art. 25 — PII loaded without data protection by design**
   - **Risk**: 20 people get unmasked access to name, email, IP, support tickets immediately on migration. GDPR requires controls built in from the start
   - **Impact**: Formal DPA investigation upon complaint; Art. 83(4) fines (up to €10M or 2% global revenue for Art. 25 violation)
   - **Mitigation**: Implement BigQuery Column-Level Security with Policy Tags before loading PII. Classify columns as `PII_DIRECT` (email, name), `PII_INDIRECT` (IP), `PII_SENSITIVE` (support text). Assign Policy Tags at schema creation; analysts without masking reader role see tokenized values only

2. **No erasure path for Art. 17 "right to be forgotten"**
   - **Risk**: When a user submits a deletion request, there is no automated way to remove their events from BigQuery tables
   - **Impact**: GDPR requires erasure within 30 days of a verified request. Non-compliance is automatically reportable. Manual deletion from event tables is infeasible at 2M events/day
   - **Mitigation**: Partition event tables by `user_id` hash + `event_date`. Erasure = `DELETE FROM events WHERE user_id = ?` on partitioned columns (BigQuery supports partition-scoped DML efficiently). Add this to the pre-migration schema design

3. **DPA with Google Cloud not confirmed**
   - **Risk**: Processing EU personal data on GCP without a signed DPA is a GDPR Art. 28 violation
   - **Impact**: Google Cloud's Data Processing Amendment is available and standard — but it must be explicitly accepted in the GCP console before EU data is loaded
   - **Mitigation**: Confirm DPA acceptance in GCP Organization settings before migration date. Takes < 1 hour; blocks migration if not done

### 🟡 Medium-Priority Issues

1. **Support ticket free text not inventoried for special-category data**
   - **Risk**: Support tickets may contain health information, financial account details, or other Art. 9 special-category data — which requires explicit consent and stricter handling than standard PII
   - **Mitigation**: Run a sample classification job on 10K tickets before migration to identify special-category data patterns. Decide: mask entirely, or store separately with stricter access

2. **Schema drift: MySQL → BigQuery type mapping not documented**
   - **Risk**: MySQL `DATETIME` → BigQuery `TIMESTAMP` conversions have timezone semantics differences. MySQL `TINYINT(1)` is often used as boolean but BigQuery has a native `BOOL` type
   - **Impact**: Silent data corruption in aggregations if types are mapped incorrectly
   - **Mitigation**: Document and test all type mappings before cutover; run a row count and aggregation comparison between MySQL and BigQuery post-load

3. **No data quality baseline before decommission**
   - **Risk**: Once MySQL is decommissioned, there is no source-of-truth to reconcile against if BigQuery data is found to be incorrect
   - **Mitigation**: Keep MySQL in read-only mode for 30 days post-cutover; run daily row-count and aggregate-level checks

## ⚠️ Assumptions Challenged

| Assumption | Challenge | Evidence | Risk if wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Governance can wait until after migration" | GDPR Art. 25 requires protection by design — at load time, not after | GDPR Art. 25 text | Compliance gap starts day 1 of migration |
| "BigQuery access is limited to a small team" | 20 engineers + analysts confirmed | Confirmed by team | All 20 get unmasked PII access |
| "Support tickets are safe to migrate as-is" | Free text may contain health/financial data | GDPR Art. 9 classification | Possible special-category violation |
| "MySQL decommission in 2 weeks" | No validation baseline + no erasure path = unsafe to decommission | Migration risk | Cannot decommission without 30-day parallel run |

---

## 🎯 Edge Cases & Failure Modes

| Scenario | What Happens | Handled? | Risk | Fix |
|----------|-------------|----------|------|-----|
| GDPR erasure request received day 1 | No erasure path; 30-day clock starts; SLA impossible | ❌ No | High | Partition by user_id before migration |
| BigQuery type mapping error on dates | Silent wrong aggregations in dashboards | ❌ No | Medium | Type mapping QA before cutover |
| Analyst queries unmasked email for debugging | PII accessed without business justification | ❌ No | High | Column-level masking before load |
| MySQL decommissioned; BigQuery has row count mismatch | No source of truth to compare against | ❌ No | Medium | 30-day parallel read-only retention |
| DPA not signed; GCP audit | GDPR Art. 28 violation documented | ❌ No | High | Check and sign DPA before migration |

## ✅ Revised Migration Plan (Recommended)

### Pre-Migration (Week 1, add to existing plan)
- [ ] Confirm and accept Google Cloud Data Processing Amendment (DPA) in GCP Organization settings
- [ ] Design BigQuery schema with Policy Tags on PII columns (`email`, `name`, `ip_address`, `support_text`)
- [ ] Create IAM taxonomy: `analyst-pii-reader` role (masked), `engineer-pii-admin` role (unmasked for approved use cases), default = masked
- [ ] Run support ticket sample (10K records) through a text classifier to identify special-category data patterns
- [ ] Design erasure path: partition event tables by `user_id_hash` + `event_date`; document deletion query template

### Migration (Week 2, as planned)
- [ ] Load data with Policy Tags applied from day 1 — never load unmasked then mask later
- [ ] Validate row counts, aggregates, and type conversions before cutting over dashboards

### Post-Migration (Week 3–6 — do NOT decommission MySQL earlier)
- [ ] Run daily reconciliation: MySQL vs. BigQuery row counts and key aggregates
- [ ] Test the erasure path end-to-end with a synthetic user record
- [ ] After 30-day validation window: decommission MySQL
