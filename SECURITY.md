# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Devil's Advocate is a documentation-only skill (Markdown files). There is no compiled code, binary, or runtime. Security concerns relate primarily to:

- Instruction integrity (the skill's guidance should not be misleading or harmful)
- Content accuracy (risk analysis frameworks should reflect current best practices)

| Version | Supported |
|---------|-----------|
| Latest (`main` branch) | ✅ Active |
| Tagged releases | ✅ For their stated version scope |
