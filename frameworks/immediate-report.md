# ⚡ Immediate Report Protocol

> **Purpose**: As soon as any 🟠 High or 🔴 Critical finding is detected during analysis — even before the full sweep is complete — emit an **Immediate Report** flash alert and request all additional context needed to complete an absolute, definitive analysis.
>
> The Immediate Report does **not** wait. It fires on the **first significant finding**.

**Key distinction from Handbrake:**
| | Immediate Report | Handbrake |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | First 🟠 High OR 🔴 Critical | 🔴 Critical only (or 3+ 🟠 same domain) |
| Action | Flash alert + context request | Full stop + specialist escalation |
| Analysis | Continues | Pauses |
| Who provides context | Anyone — user, the person who proposed the plan | Domain specialist only |
| Depth | Broad: all dimensions | Deep: specific domain + pre-mortem |

> **When the first finding is already 🔴 Critical**: The Immediate Report and Handbrake fire on the same finding. Merge them into a **single combined block** — do not emit two separate messages. The combined block includes: the flash alert, the context request, and the Handbrake escalation question set. See the structure in `examples/handbrake-example.md`.

## Trigger Conditions

Activate immediately upon detecting **any** of:

| Condition | Threshold |
|-----------|-----------|
| Single 🔴 Critical finding | 1 finding |
| Single 🟠 High finding | 1 finding |
| Pattern of 🟡 Medium findings pointing to the same root cause | 3+ in same domain |
| An assumption that is **entirely unverified** and load-bearing | 1 assumption |
| A failure mode with **no defined mitigation** | 1 unmitigated High/Critical |
| An irreversible action with no rollback plan | 1 finding |

```

---

### 🎨 UX / Design — Accessibility / Dark Patterns / Error States

```markdown
1. **User research basis**: Has this flow been validated with real users (usability test, A/B, analytics data)?
2. **Error state coverage**: Are error, empty, loading, offline, and partial-failure states designed and included in specs?
3. **Accessibility test**: Has this flow been tested with a screen reader, keyboard-only navigation, or automated WCAG checker?

### 🤖 AI Optimization — Context / Instructions Quality

```markdown
1. **File inventory**: List all AI context files in the project (AGENTS.md, .cursorrules, .ai-context.md, CLAUDE.md, README.md, etc.) and their approximate sizes in tokens or KB.
2. **Load strategy**: Which files are always loaded vs. loaded on-demand? Is there an explicit loading strategy documented for this project?

### 🔀 Version Control — Repository Operations / Git Hygiene

```markdown
1. **Platform**: Is this repository on GitHub, GitLab, or another platform? Are branch protection rules enabled on the default branch?
2. **Secret exposure**: If a secret is involved — has it been rotated yet? Were any CI/CD pipelines triggered that may have printed the value in plain text in job logs?
3. **Contributor state**: How many contributors have active local clones or branches pointing to the commits to be modified? Is there a coordination channel to notify them?
4. **Active branches**: Are there other branches (feature, release) that share the affected commits and also need to be rewritten or force-pushed?
5. **Force push safety**: Will `--force-with-lease` be used instead of `--force`? Is there a write-freeze window planned to prevent concurrent pushes during the operation?
6. **Downstream impact**: Which systems reference the current commit SHAs — CI/CD pipelines, open PRs/MRs, release tags, external artifact stores, or deployment tooling?
```

## Multi-Finding Immediate Report

When multiple High/Critical findings are detected in the same sweep, group them:

```markdown
---
## ⚡ IMMEDIATE REPORT — Multiple High/Critical Findings

**Findings detected so far** (analysis still in progress):

| # | Severity | Finding | Domain | Unmitigated? |
|---|----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 🔴 Critical | [Description] | [Domain] | ❌ Yes |
| 2 | 🟠 High | [Description] | [Domain] | ⚠️ Partial |
| 3 | 🟠 High | [Description] | [Domain] | ❌ Yes |

**Combined blast radius**: [What fails if all three occur simultaneously]

---
### 🔍 Priority Context Needed

To complete a definitive analysis, please provide:

**For Finding #1 (🔴 Critical — [Domain]):**
[3 most critical questions from the relevant template]

**For Finding #2 (🟠 High — [Domain]):**
[2 most critical questions]

**For Finding #3 (🟠 High — [Domain]):**
[2 most critical questions]

---
Reply with what you know. Partial answers are better than none.
Type `continue` to proceed without additional context (findings will be marked ⚠️ Unverified).
---
```

---

## Context Sufficiency Assessment

After receiving context, assess it before incorporating:

```markdown
| Question | Answered? | Impact on Risk Rating |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| [Q1] | ✅ Full / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ No | Risk lowered / unchanged / raised |
| [Q2] | ✅ Full / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ No | Risk lowered / unchanged / raised |

**Context sufficiency**: 🟢 Complete (≥80% answered) / 🟡 Partial (50–79%) / 🔴 Insufficient (<50%)

**Analysis confidence**: [High / Medium / Low] — reflects how much unverified context remains.
```

---

## `continue` Command Behavior

When the user types `continue` without providing context:
- Mark all findings with unanswered questions as **⚠️ Unverified Context**
- Assign **conservative (worst-case) risk score** to those findings
- Note in the report: `"Risk rated at worst-case due to missing context. Actual risk may be lower if [specific condition] is confirmed."`
- Proceed to the full report and Gate prompt normally

---

## Integration Rules

| Situation | What happens |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🟠 High found, no Critical | ⚡ Immediate Report fires. Analysis continues. Gate at end. |
| 🔴 Critical found | ⚡ Immediate Report fires first. Then 🛑 Handbrake activates. |
| Multiple Critical findings | ⚡ Multi-Finding Immediate Report. 🛑 Multi-Role Handbrake. |
| User answers context before analysis ends | Incorporate immediately into remaining analysis steps |
| User types `continue` | Mark as unverified, worst-case score, proceed |
| User bypasses | ⚠️ Warning prepended, proceed with Gate |
