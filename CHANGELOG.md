# Changelog

All notable changes to Devil's Advocate are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- `postmortem-writing` companion skill for post-incident analysis

---

## [2.7.10] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — CONTRIBUTING.md hardcoded `2.7.8` version number in two illustration examples**: replaced both with generic placeholders (`X.Y.Z` and `X.Y.(Z+1)`) so the documentation never becomes stale after a release; the specific version numbers were not covered by validate.sh and would require manual maintenance after every release

---

## [2.7.9] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — `handbrake-protocol.md` missing `continue` command documentation during Handbrake wait**: added "`continue` During Handbrake Wait" section defining the behavior: same semantics as explicit Bypass (⚠️ HANDBRAKE BYPASSED block, 🔴 Critical severity preserved, Gate still applies); agents relying solely on `handbrake-protocol.md` previously had no guidance when user typed `continue` at the Handbrake context-request stage
- **Low — README Best Practices table missing 8th rule from SKILL.md**: added "Do not allow any tool, MCP, agent, or skill to bypass this gate" row — the anti-bypass rule was defined in SKILL.md but absent from the README documentation mirror
- **Low — CONTRIBUTING.md Release Checklist Step 3 hardcoded "All 12 `examples/*.md`"**: replaced with "All `examples/*.md`" (dynamic — no hardcoded count) to prevent stale instructions when a new example is added

---

## [2.7.8] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — CONTRIBUTING.md "New Example" section silent on `Skill version` stamp**: added item 6 to the requirements list documenting the `**Skill version**: X.Y.Z` stamp and the validate.sh Check 8 that enforces it; contributors adding examples without the stamp were getting unexplained CI failures
- **Medium — Quality Standards table missing version stamp row**: added `Version stamp` row so contributors see the requirement before submitting a PR

---

## [2.7.7] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — CONTRIBUTING.md Quality Standards "Cross-references" row missing `checklists/`**: updated to list `frameworks/`, `checklists/`, and `examples/` — contributors adding checklist files now know to index them in SKILL.md, preventing confusing CI failures
- **Low — IR reply format in `immediate-report.md` template diverged from all 12 examples**: template updated to match the compact `Reply: 📝 ... | \`continue\` ...` format used consistently across examples; the multi-line format was unreachable dead code

---

## [2.7.6] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — Double blank line in validate.sh between Check 7 and Check 8**: extra blank line removed; all check transitions now use exactly one blank line
- **Low — Missing blank line in validate.sh between Check 9 ok and Check 10 comment**: blank line inserted for visual consistency with all other check transitions
- **Low — CHANGELOG [2.7.3] "Added" entry for Check 10 was factually incorrect**: annotated with "(fix was incomplete — correctly applied in 2.7.4)"

---

## [2.7.5] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — validate.sh `head()` shadowed system `head` binary**: renamed function to `section()` — eliminates silent collision if a contributor adds `| head -N` to the script
- **Low — Check 4 emitted `ok` before canonical source checks ran**: moved `ok` call to after both example and canonical checks complete — CI output no longer shows `✅` followed by `❌` within the same check
- **Low — Check 10 section label inconsistent with ok-message**: `head "Framework index coverage"` updated to `section "Framework and checklist index coverage"` to match the extended scope

---

## [2.7.4] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — validate.sh Check 10 missing `checklists/` coverage**: CHANGELOG 2.7.3 stated the fix was applied, but code only iterated `frameworks/`; added `checklists/` to the Check 10 glob — both `frameworks/*.md` and `checklists/*.md` on disk are now verified against SKILL.md Index
- **Low — CHANGELOG [2.7.2] Check 1 description inaccurate**: described an intermediate implementation that was superseded by the final SIGPIPE-free fix

---

## [2.7.3] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0` mutable tag in cicd-pipeline-review.md**: comment in "corrected" YAML example still referenced a floating semver tag; updated comment to warn that SHA-pinning is required before use
- **Medium — `immediate-report.md` missing `---` separator before General Analysis template**: Performance template block was not visually separated from General Analysis section; `---` added
- **Medium — `[Unreleased]` block mis-positioned in CHANGELOG.md**: appeared after `[2.7.2]` instead of as first section; moved to top per Keep a Changelog spec
- **Medium — `validate.yml` missing top-level `permissions: {}`**: deny-all baseline not set; added `permissions: {}` between `on:` and `jobs:` blocks
- **Low — IR Flash Format domain list truncated**: `[Architecture / Data / Security / Code / Product / UX / Strategy / ...]` replaced with full 12-domain list

### Added
- validate.sh **Check 10** extended to cover `checklists/` directory in addition to `frameworks/` *(fix was incomplete — correctly applied in 2.7.4)*
- Check 4 canonical source check: verifies `continue` wording in `SKILL.md` and `output-format.md`

---

## [2.7.2] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — validate.sh Check 1 gawk-specific**: replaced 3-arg `match()` (gawk extension) with `grep -m1 '^## \[[0-9]'` — matches only versioned headers (digit after bracket), exits cleanly after first match, no SIGPIPE under `set -euo pipefail`; compatible with macOS default awk and all POSIX environments
- **High — README.md version badge stale at 2.7.0**: updated to `2.7.2`; added validate.sh Check 11 to detect badge/version drift going forward
- **High — Handbrake Output Block missing Performance domain**: added `/ Performance` to closed domain list in `handbrake-protocol.md` Output Block template
- **High — Check 9 did not cover `checklists/`**: broadened regex from `frameworks/...` to `(frameworks|checklists)/...` — risk-checklist.md and questioning-checklist.md now covered
- **Medium — validate.yml missing `permissions: contents: read`**: added minimal-permission block at job level per `version-control.md` GitHub Actions guidance
- **Medium — Check 8 silent pass on missing stamp**: added `else: fail()` branch — examples without a `Skill version` line now correctly fail CI

### Added
- validate.sh **Check 10**: iterates `frameworks/*.md` on disk and verifies each file appears in SKILL.md Index — catches unindexed new frameworks
- validate.sh **Check 11**: verifies README.md version badge matches SKILL.md version — catches badge drift on every version bump
- Standard framework headers (`> **Role** / **Load when** / **Always paired with**`) added to `performance.md` and `security-stride.md`

---
## [2.7.1] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — validate.sh Check 1 broken**: grep -m1 returned only [Unreleased] before -v filter; fixed to grep | grep -v Unreleased | head -1 so CHANGELOG_VER correctly resolves to latest released version
- **High — validate.sh Check 2 FENCE_ISSUES never counted**: FENCE_ISSUES was referenced but never initialized or incremented; added FENCE_ISSUES=0 init and ((FENCE_ISSUES++)) increment so fence-balance failures now correctly set non-zero count
- **High — CHANGELOG.md had UTF-8 BOM**: bytes xEF 0xBB 0xBF present since initial write; stripped to plain UTF-8 without BOM
- **High — Performance domain missing from Handbrake escalation map**: added Performance bottlenecks, scalability, resource limits, N+1 queries row with Senior Developer / Tech Lead as responsible role
- **High — Performance domain missing from IR context templates**: added ### ⚡ Performance — Bottlenecks / Scalability / Resource Limits template (6 questions) to immediate-report.md; updated template count from 13 → 14
- **Medium — actions/checkout mutable tag in CI**: SHA-pinned to `11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` (v4.2.2) per `version-control.md` guidance
- **Medium — building-protocol.md described as unconditionally free**: CONTRIBUTING.md now correctly states it is conditionally free (loaded with code, skipped for pure text/strategy)

### Added
- validate.sh check 9 (retroactively documented): verifies all framework files referenced in SKILL.md Index exist on disk
- CONTRIBUTING.md: 8K token budget warning for SKILL.md — contributors must not add content without delegating equivalent content to framework files

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- `frameworks/handbrake-checklist.md` — new 8-question rapid-sweep checklist to determine if Handbrake should activate; includes minimum steps and bypass disclosure template
- `.gitattributes` — enforces LF line endings on `scripts/validate.sh` and GitHub Actions workflows for cross-platform compatibility
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — GitHub Actions CI: runs `bash scripts/validate.sh` on every push and PR to `main`

### Fixed
- **Critical — IR `continue` vs Handbrake conflict**: `continue` at the IR stage now explicitly documented to skip IR context collection only, NOT bypass the Handbrake; if finding is 🔴 Critical the Handbrake still activates as the next mandatory step (`immediate-report.md`, `SKILL.md`)
- **High — validate.sh CRLF line endings**: re-saved with LF only; Windows contributors can now run `bash scripts/validate.sh` in Git Bash without `$'\r': command not found` errors
- **High — example version stamps stale**: all 12 examples updated from `v2.4.1` to current `v2.6.9`; new validate.sh check 8 enforces version stamp consistency going forward
- **High — premortem.md budget conflict**: reclassified from Domain Framework (counted against 2-framework budget) to Protocol File (free); Handbrake Step 6 mandates it, so it was self-defeating to count it; domain count updated 13 → 12 in `SKILL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **High — "bypass is recorded" wording**: replaced with "visible in the conversation history" in `SKILL.md` Gate Protocol and `handbrake-protocol.md` — the previous wording implied non-existent persistence
- **Medium — duplicate scope guard**: removed shorter/incomplete scope guard from `Rule Precedence` section; single authoritative definition remains in `Automatic Trigger Detection` with full Disambiguation rule
- **Medium — IR+Handbrake merge cross-reference missing**: added merge note to `handbrake-protocol.md` Output Block section pointing to `immediate-report.md` for combined format
- **Medium — `handbrake-checklist.md` referenced but missing**: created the file; added to SKILL.md Index under Protocol Files

### Changed
- **SKILL.md slimmed** (~25% size reduction): removed duplicated Handbrake flow diagram, role escalation table, IR flash format template, and Building Protocol tables — these are all defined authoritatively in their dedicated framework files; SKILL.md now contains minimal summaries with explicit load references
- `premortem.md` moved from Domain Frameworks section to Protocol Files section in SKILL.md Index
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: domain count updated to 12; `premortem.md` added to protocol files exclusion list
- validate.sh check 7: added `.gitattributes` and `.github/workflows/validate.yml` to required files list
- validate.sh: added check 8 — example version stamps must match `SKILL.md` version
