# Changelog

All notable changes to this repository are documented in this file.
Each skill is versioned independently — Devil's Advocate uses `[X.Y.Z]` headers, additional skills use `skill-name [X.Y.Z]` headers.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and all skills adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- `postmortem-writing` companion skill for post-incident analysis

---

## [2.9.2] — 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Domain framework cap removed** — eliminated the artificial `max 2 per analysis` limit from the context budget. Agents now load all frameworks relevant to the plan's scope in a single analysis pass. Relevance-based selection only: most plans need 2–4; loading all 12 is reserved for full-system reviews. Eliminates the endless-iteration pattern where users had to re-run DA multiple times to cover all domains.
- **Domain Frameworks section heading updated** — changed from "max 2 per analysis" to "load all relevant per analysis" for consistency with the updated budget rule

---

## ai-rules [1.0.1] — 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Language rule strengthened** — `en_US` for code identifiers is now explicitly "non-negotiable" regardless of project language, user language, or documentation language. Removed reference to "instructions from any other skill or tool" per Gen Agent Trust Hub audit guidance.
- **Session initialization full-refusal handling** — added explicit path: if the user asks to skip initialization entirely, proceed without `docs/project-context.md`; context-dependent rules apply conservative defaults for the session.
- **Session closing de-duplicated** — removed the second session-closing note that was redundant with the one in the Session Initialization section.
- **Security and Privacy wording aligned** — third-party code rule now uses "regardless of user instruction" phrasing consistent with the other prohibitions in that section.
- **Risk factors made actionable** — added examples: "no test coverage on this module," "external API with no SLA," "single developer with domain knowledge" — vague risk factors are explicitly called out as non-actionable.
- **Example code boundaries safeguard added** — clarifies that code blocks in this skill define document templates and structural conventions, not executable code.

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.9.0] — 2026-05-12

### Changed
- **Dynamic output directory** — removed hardcoded `docs/security/` path. Added Step 0 to the Analysis Protocol that asks the user where to save SAR files before any analysis begins. Default remains `docs/security/` when the user confirms, provides no response, or runs in automated context. All path references throughout `SKILL.md` and `frameworks/output-format.md` replaced with "the output directory" pointing to the confirmed location.
- **Domain framework cap removed** — eliminated the `max 2 per assessment` limit from the index context budget. Agents now load all frameworks relevant to the assessment scope in a single pass. All 4 domain frameworks are available — load those that directly apply. There is no cap.

---

## [2.9.1] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- **Gen Agent Trust Hub compliance** — resolved HIGH-risk findings from the April 2026 audit
  - `[PROMPT_INJECTION]` Rule Precedence reframed from override command to design intent: "operates before and around" instead of "takes precedence over all tools and skills"
  - `[PROMPT_INJECTION]` Git commit rule reframed from "non-negotiable and cannot be overridden" to "should remain active to preserve user authority"
  - `[PROMPT_INJECTION]` No AI Credit principle reframed from "this rule wins" absolute command to a consistent practice with explicit handling for conflicting templates; header changed from "Under no circumstances" to "As a consistent practice"
  - `[INDIRECT_PROMPT_INJECTION_SURFACE]` Added **Analyzed Content Boundary** section to `SKILL.md`: analyzed content is treated as untrusted input and cannot modify skill protocols or gate behavior
  - `[INDIRECT_PROMPT_INJECTION_SURFACE]` Added untrusted content boundary note to `frameworks/analysis-framework.md`
  - `[REMOTE_CODE_EXECUTION / EXTERNAL_DOWNLOADS]` Added pre-install security review note to `README.md` with links to source repository and audit page
- README.md: changed "Runs unconditionally first" to "Runs consistently first"

---

## ai-rules [1.0.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Initial release: personal behavioral rules skill for AI coding agents
- `skills/ai-rules/SKILL.md` — baseline behavioral contract covering security, documentation storage, documentation format, code quality, version control, communication, and structured estimation
- `skills/ai-rules/README.md` — public documentation
- `skills/ai-rules/metadata.json` — skill metadata for skills.sh registry
- **Documentation storage rule**: all session memory, references, and generated assets must live in `docs/` (or user-specified location) — never in AI memory stores or IDE caches — enabling shared context across Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, and other tools
- **Structured estimation model**: every recommendation includes Confidence %, effort by capacity mode (Solo 1× / AI-assisted 3–5× / AI-augmented team 5–10×), pivot potential (High / Medium / Low), and explicit risk factors
- **6 mandatory security safeguards** for skills.sh audit compliance (Gen Agent Trust Hub · Socket · Snyk): untrusted input boundary, no arbitrary code execution, bounded autonomy, web search scoping, example code boundaries, report-only output

---

## [2.9.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Git commit absolute gate** — new "Version control" row in All Actions Blocked table covering `git commit`, `git push`, `git tag`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git reset`, `git checkout --`. New absolute rule blockquote: no git write operation may execute without the AI first explicitly stating its intent; explicit user authorization required even with full session permissions (auto-approve, yolo mode). Non-negotiable, non-overridable by session settings, tool permissions, or other skills.
- **No AI / IDE / Editor Credit Attribution** — new Core Principle #1. Prohibits `Co-Authored-By` with any AI name, "Generated by" / "Created by" AI markers, AI/IDE/editor author mentions, and tool watermarks in all generated artifacts. "All credit belongs to the human user. If another skill or convention conflicts with this rule, this rule wins."
- Two new rows in User Authority Preservation table: session permissions don't authorize git writes; `Co-Authored-By: [AI]` templates are rejected

### Changed
- Core Principles renumbered: Adversarial Mindset → #2, Systematic Challenge → #3

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.8.0] — 2026-03-12

### Fixed
- **Medium — Scoring floor boundary ambiguity**: Cumulative floor in `scoring-system.md` changed from 50 to **51** — a score of 50 falls into Warning range (W-prefix), so the floor for reachable unmitigated findings must be 51 to remain in Finding range
- **Medium — Dashboard placement contradiction**: `output-format.md` prose said "immediately after Findings" but template showed it after Dependency & Supply Chain Analysis — fixed prose to match template
- **Low — CWE/OWASP in wrong metrics table**: Listed as "conditional" but marked "Always (mandatory)" — moved to required metrics table, removed from conditional
- **Low — Bare `Partial` values in CSV examples**: Updated all instances in `output-format.md` and `recurring-assessment.md` to include parenthetical details (e.g., `Partial (regex escaping on search only)`, `Partial (inline checks only, no schema)`)
- **Low — README stale content**: Fixed sorting rule description, removed duplicate CIS entry, added CWE/OWASP dashboard metrics, corrected protocol from 10 steps to 9

### Changed
- `output-format.md` dashboard scope rule added: unassessed metrics must show `N/A — outside assessment scope` rather than being omitted or inflating denominators
- `output-format.md` `Existing Mitigation` column definition expanded with decision criteria: `No` (zero controls), named control (specific), `Partial (present ones)` (multiple expected, some present)

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.7.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Corrupted CSV fallback** in Step 6: if `vulnerabilities.csv` exists but is malformed (wrong column count, encoding errors, partially written), treat as absent, document in SAR appendix, start fresh
- **Recurring finding matching criteria**: match by CWE ID(s) + affected component; if uncertain, treat as new and note potential overlap
- **Step 8 explicit operations**: add new with `Pending`, update recurring scores, preserve team-managed fields, never delete rows — plus CSV validation sub-step (11 columns, no duplicate IDs, team fields preserved, sort order correct)
- **Sequential assessments exception** in Step 9: context release applies only after last assessment when scope is split into multiple assessments in same conversation
- **Bilingual opt-out** in Quick Reference: `Generate both EN + ES files` now says "unless user requests single-language output"
- **CWE staleness fallback** in `dependency-supply-chain.md`: when web search is unavailable, note in SAR appendix that CWE Top 25 list was not verified against current year's publication
- **Cross-reference budget annotations** in `injection-patterns.md`, `storage-exfiltration.md`, and `dependency-supply-chain.md`: all cross-reference links now note `*(domain framework — counts toward budget)*`

### Changed
- `compliance-standards.md` header updated: load only when full expanded reference or lesser-known standards are needed — agent can map well-known standards from training knowledge without loading this file
- SKILL.md constraint 3 sorting rule: "sorted by status group then Score descending" (was "Sort by Score descending")
- `output-format.md` generation rule 2: changed from "Sort by Score descending" to "Sort by status group, then Score descending" — open findings first, then open warnings, then mitigated entries

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.6.0] — 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Vulnerabilities Registry** (`vulnerabilities.csv`) — persistent CSV registry with 11 columns, status lifecycle (`Pending → In Development → Processing → In QA → In Staging → Mitigated`), agent-controlled vs team-controlled fields, group-then-sort ordering, and ID continuity rules. Full schema and generation rules in `output-format.md`
- **Mitigated Findings section** — mandatory SAR section when CSV contains mitigated entries: `[MITIGATED]` label, detection/mitigation dates, original SAR link, ordered by mitigation date descending
- **Worst-finding title rule** — SAR filename and heading must reflect the highest-scoring vulnerability (SCREAMING-KEBAB-CASE, max 50 chars). Title derivation table with 7 examples in `output-format.md`
- **Dependency & Supply Chain Analysis** as mandatory Step 2 — `dependency-supply-chain.md` promoted to protocol file (free to load). Audits all packages (direct + transitive) against NVD, GitHub Advisories, OSV; evaluates integrated skills/plugins; maps to CWE/MITRE Top 25, OWASP Top 10 (A06, A08), SANS/CIS Top 20 (CIS 2, 7, 16, 18)
- **CWE ID mandatory for every finding** — Step 5 (Score and Document) now requires CWE identifier(s) cross-referenced against CWE/MITRE Top 25
- **Context release protocol** (Step 9) — after SAR and CSV are written, agent discards assessment context; generated files become single source of truth; exception for explicit continuation requests
- **Operating Constraints expanded** from 9 to 12: added #2 (Worst-finding title), #3 (Vulnerabilities registry), #12 (Context release after completion)
- **Recurring assessment example** (`examples/recurring-assessment.md`) — second SAR on same project showing mitigated finding (F01), recurring entries, CSV update flow
- CWE/MITRE Top 25 and OWASP Top 10 Alignment added as required dashboard metrics
- Dependency Vulnerability Rate, Version Pinning Rate, Skills/Plugins Security Rate added as conditional dashboard metrics
- New Quick Reference rows: SAR title from worst finding, update `vulnerabilities.csv`, overwrite team-managed fields (never), show mitigated findings, delete CSV rows (never), retain context after SAR (never), finding without CWE (never), skip dependency audit (never), skip skills evaluation (never)
- `compliance-standards.md`: added CWE/MITRE Top 25 to baseline table + expanded reference + 4 new selection guide rows (vulnerable dependency, supply chain integrity, excessive permissions, code-level findings)
- `metadata.json` keywords expanded: `owasp-top-10`, `cwe-top-25`, `sans-top-20`, `cis-controls`, `supply-chain-security`, `dependency-audit`

### Changed
- **Analysis Protocol restructured from 5 steps to 9 steps**: (1) Map Entry Points → (2) Audit Dependencies → (3) Trace Execution Flows → (4) Evaluate Controls → (5) Score and Document → (6) Read Vulnerabilities Registry → (7) Write Output Files → (8) Update Vulnerabilities Registry → (9) Release Context
- CIS Controls description updated from "formerly SANS Top 20" to "SANS Top 20, now CIS Controls v8 with 18 control categories"
- SKILL.md Index: `compliance-standards.md` description updated to "22 baseline standards"; `dependency-supply-chain.md` added to protocol files section
- README.md rewritten: 10-step workflow diagram, progressive context loading updated (3 protocol files), output section includes `vulnerabilities.csv`, edge cases expanded to 10

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.5.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Security Posture Dashboard** — mandatory section in every SAR report with quantitative coverage metrics that serve as measurable OKRs
  - 13 required metrics: Assessment Coverage, Secure Surface, Critical/High/Medium Exposure, Auth Coverage, Input Validation Coverage, Parameterized Query Rate, Secrets Hygiene, Encryption Coverage, Compliance Alignment, Mean Finding Score, Remediation Priority Index
  - 6 conditional metrics: Cloud Storage Secure Rate, CORS Policy Compliance, Rate Limiting Coverage, Logging & Monitoring Rate, Dependency Vulnerability Rate, RBAC Enforcement Rate
  - Severity Distribution breakdown table (count + % of findings + % of surface per severity level)
  - Rating thresholds (✅ Good ≥ 80%, ⚠️ Needs improvement 50–79%, 🟥 Critical < 50%)
  - All metrics require both percentage and raw count — e.g., `62% (30/48)`
- Updated `output-format.md` with full dashboard specification, presentation format, and rating system
- Updated SKILL.md Step 5 to reference dashboard generation as mandatory
- Updated README.md with dashboard documentation and feature highlight

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.4.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Structural rewrite for Socket audit compliance**: Replaced all pseudocode `text` blocks in 5 flagged example files with narrative markdown (bullet lists + inline text). Previous v1.3.0 approach (token-level replacement) was insufficient — Socket performs semantic analysis, not keyword matching.
  - `nosql-operator-injection.md` — removed code block with database query methods and operator syntax; replaced Scenario with **Finding location** bullets referencing `injection-patterns.md`; abstracted Assessment Trace (no ORM/ODM method names)
  - `regex-redos-injection.md` — removed code block with regex constructor and database regex queries; replaced with narrative bullets; Evidence converted to inline text
  - `secrets-in-source-control.md` — removed all 3 code blocks (file discovery, sensitive content patterns, hardcoded credentials); replaced with narrative markdown; eliminated environment file names and connection string patterns
  - `mass-assignment.md` — removed code block with ORM update method, request body passthrough, and schema field listing; replaced Scenario and Assessment Trace with generic descriptions referencing framework tables
  - `public-cloud-bucket.md` — removed both code blocks (IaC pattern and bucket policy); eliminated cloud-provider-specific syntax; replaced with narrative bullets
- **README.md Edge Cases sanitized**: Replaced inline code references with natural language in NoSQL Operator Injection, Public Cloud Storage Bucket, and Secrets in Source Control sections; cleaned directory tree annotation
- **SKILL.md index table**: Replaced ORM-specific method reference with generic description

### Fixed
- `mass-assignment.md` Scenario section was not applied in v1.3.0 due to a silent replacement failure — now fully rewritten

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.3.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed
- **Socket security audit compliance** (superseded by v1.4.0): Initial attempt at sanitizing 5 example files — replaced specific operator syntax with natural language equivalents. Approach proved insufficient as Socket scanner uses semantic analysis rather than keyword detection.
  - `nosql-operator-injection.md` — replaced MongoDB operator syntax with natural language descriptions
  - `secrets-in-source-control.md` — replaced secret variable names with generic placeholders
  - `mass-assignment.md` — replaced privilege escalation payloads with descriptive text
  - `regex-redos-injection.md` — replaced regex attack patterns and MongoDB regex operator references
  - `public-cloud-bucket.md` — replaced Terraform/AWS policy syntax with natural language
- **Preventive sanitization**: Cleaned narrative-context patterns in `README.md` and `scoring-system.md`
- Updated SKILL.md index table (removed `$ne` operator syntax from description)

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.2.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Confidentiality Primacy** principle in scoring system — data exfiltration always scores higher than availability-only
- 4 impact classifications: data exfiltration, integrity violation, dual-vector, availability-only
- Availability-only gate: vulnerabilities with zero data exposure capped at 49 (Warning max)
- Operating Constraint #9 (Confidentiality primacy) in SKILL.md
- Impact classification as first step in Step 4 analysis protocol

### Changed
- Rewrote `regex-redos-injection.md` — score driven by exfiltration vector, ReDoS noted as secondary
- Updated `injection-patterns.md` Regex section: split patterns by Primary Impact
- Updated `scoring-system.md` comparative table with exfiltration-aware scores

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.1.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Multi-factor scoring system** with 3 dimensions: Exploitation Complexity, Impact Scope, Data Sensitivity
- Mandatory Score Justification field in all findings
- Comparative Scoring Reference table in `scoring-system.md`
- Operating Constraint #6 (Differentiated scoring) in SKILL.md
- `examples/sql-injection-comparison.md` — same vuln type with scores 92 vs 55

### Changed
- Rewrote `scoring-system.md` with multi-factor scoring methodology
- Updated `output-format.md` with Score Justification as mandatory field
- Expanded Steps 3 and 4 in SKILL.md analysis protocol

---

## sar-cybersecurity [1.0.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **Initial release**: Automated Security Assessment Report (SAR) generator for AI coding agents — deep cybersecurity analysis mapped to 20+ compliance standards (ISO 27001, NIST, OWASP, PCI-DSS, GDPR, MITRE ATT&CK)
- `skills/sar-cybersecurity/SKILL.md` — core skill definition (~170 lines) with 7 operating constraints, progressive context loading via Index section with context budget rules, 5-step analysis protocol, bounded expert scope, and full skills.sh security audit compliance

- **Domain frameworks** (max 2 per assessment):
  - `frameworks/compliance-standards.md` — 20 baseline compliance standards with expanded descriptions and selection guide
  - `frameworks/database-access-protocol.md` — SQL, NoSQL, Redis inspection protocol with bounded queries and index verification
  - `frameworks/injection-patterns.md` — 6 injection families: SQL, NoSQL Operator, Regex/ReDoS, Mass Assignment, GraphQL, ORM/ODM
  - `frameworks/storage-exfiltration.md` — 7 data leakage categories: cloud storage, secrets, file uploads, logging, message queues, CDN, IaC
- **Examples** (8 canonical edge cases):
  - `examples/unreachable-vulnerability.md` — dead code with SQL injection (score 35)
  - `examples/runtime-validation.md` — inline validation without formal structure (score 38)
  - `examples/full-flow-evaluation.md` — infrastructure-layer auth masking insecure code (score 30)
  - `examples/nosql-operator-injection.md` — MongoDB `$ne` injection, 15 endpoints (score 92)
  - `examples/regex-redos-injection.md` — ReDoS + data exfiltration, 23 occurrences (score 82)
  - `examples/mass-assignment.md` — IDOR + privilege escalation via unfiltered body (score 88)
  - `examples/public-cloud-bucket.md` — public S3 with PII, backups, and secrets (score 97)
  - `examples/secrets-in-source-control.md` — 12 secrets across 6 files, 14 months (score 93)
- All domain frameworks with code include `⚠️ Reference patterns only` boundary notes; all examples include `⚠️ Example only` boundary notes — required for skills.sh security audit compliance (Gen Agent Trust Hub, Socket, Snyk)

### Changed (repository-level)
- `.ai-context.md` created — AI agent safety context with skills.sh scanner documentation, mandatory safeguards checklist, current audit results table, and new skill onboarding guide
- `AGENTS.md` — added skills.sh Security Audit Compliance section with scanner table, 6 required safeguards, and devils-advocate gold standard reference; skills table expanded to include SAR Cybersecurity
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — added SAR Cybersecurity skill reference and skills.sh security audit compliance cross-reference
- Root `README.md` rewritten for professional monorepo presentation: correct badges, comprehensive skills table, detailed skill descriptions for both Devil's Advocate and SAR Cybersecurity, "How Skills Work Together" Mermaid diagram, compatible agents table, repository structure tree, quality gate, and contributing/security/license sections

---

## [2.8.8] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Low — Quality Standards table incomplete stale patterns**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` "No stale text" row now explicitly lists `carrilloapps/devils-advocate` alongside `with implementation` and `14-dimension` — matching all 3 patterns enforced by `validate.sh` Check 6

---

## [2.8.7] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Low — Contributor table missing DA gate files**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` "What Can I Contribute?" table now includes `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` as ⚠️ Discuss first
- **Low — PR template core protocol section missing DA gate files**: "If modifying core protocol files" section now explicitly covers `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` with the same issue-first requirement

---

## [2.8.6] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Low — PR template missing version stamp checkbox**: "If adding or modifying an example" section now includes `**Skill version**: X.Y.Z present and matches current SKILL.md version` — prevents Check 8 CI surprises for contributors

---

## [2.8.5] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Medium — PR template out of sync with quality standards**: added `carrilloapps/devils-advocate` stale pattern, en_US identifiers check, and `validate.sh` checkbox to "All PRs" section
- **Low — PR template Type of Change missing DA gate files**: `📦 Project infrastructure` type now explicitly includes `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md`
- **Low — CONTRIBUTING.md not flagging DA gate files as special**: "Improving Existing Files" now warns against weakening references to `SKILL.md` in `AGENTS.md` / `copilot-instructions.md`

---

## [2.8.4] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **Medium — False documentation claim**: `copilot-instructions.md` claimed "branch protection enforced" — replaced with actionable instruction to enable it in GitHub Settings
- **Medium — Missing AGENTS.md in repo tree**: root `README.md` repository structure tree now shows `AGENTS.md` with its purpose
- **Medium — Release checklist incomplete**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` step 3 now explicitly reminds maintainers to update the check count `(N checks)` in root `README.md` when checks are added/removed
- **Low — Quality Standards table missing Check 13**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` quality table now includes `SKILL.md token budget` row documenting the 8K-token / 32K-char CI enforcement
- **Low — AGENTS.md missing Conventions section**: added `## Conventions` (Conventional Commits, en_US, branch) to match `copilot-instructions.md` — all AI agents now receive the same contributor conventions regardless of which context file they load

---

## [2.8.3] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- **High — CI scope gap**: `validate.sh` Checks 2 (fence balance) and 6 (stale text) now scan `$REPO_ROOT` instead of `$ROOT` — root `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and all `.github/` files are now included in every CI run
- **High — Missing agent context**: Added `AGENTS.md` (repo root) and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — contributors using GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and compatible agents now auto-load the Devil's Advocate skill when working on this repository
- **Medium — Stale token count**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` token estimate updated from ~7,068 to ~7,215 tokens (28,859 bytes)
- **Medium — Discovery gap**: `metadata.json` now includes `keywords` field for `npx skills find` search indexing
- **Low — Domain count update path**: `CONTRIBUTING.md` new framework checklist now lists all three locations where the domain count must be updated

### Added
- `validate.sh` **Check 13**: SKILL.md token budget enforcement — fails if file exceeds 32,000 chars (~8,000 tokens)
- `validate.sh` **Check 7**: `AGENTS.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` added to required files list
- Total checks: 46 → **49**

---

## [2.8.2] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- Root `README.md` check count corrected: `43 checks` → `46 checks`
- `metadata.json` `date` field removed — was hardcoded and stale; not required by skills.sh
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` release checklist step 3 updated: added `metadata.json`, root `README.md` badge, and correct file paths to cascade list
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` release checklist step 6 updated: added `git tag vX.Y.Z` and `--tags` to push command

---

## [2.8.1] — 2026-02-21

### Fixed
- `.gitignore` `skills/` pattern removed — was silently ignoring all future skills in the monorepo; added inline explanation for OpenClaw users
- `SKILL.md` author footer URL updated from `carrilloapps/devils-advocate` to `carrilloapps/skills`
- `frameworks/handbrake-checklist.md` footer URL updated to `carrilloapps/skills`
- Root `README.md` repository structure tree corrected — `scripts/` shown at repo root (not inside `skills/devils-advocate/`)
- `.github/CODEOWNERS` created — requires `@carrilloapps` review for core protocol files

### Added
- `validate.sh` Check 12: `metadata.json` version compared against `SKILL.md` version
- `validate.sh` Check 6: added `carrilloapps/devils-advocate` as stale text pattern
- `validate.sh` Check 7: `metadata.json` and `.github/CODEOWNERS` added to required files list

---

## [2.8.0] — 2026-02-20

### Changed
- **Breaking — Repository restructured to skills.sh monorepo format**: all skill files moved from repo root to `skills/devils-advocate/`; install command updated from `npx skills add carrilloapps/devils-advocate` to `npx skills add https://github.com/carrilloapps/skills --skill devils-advocate`; enables the repository to host multiple skills under `skills/<name>/`

---

## [2.7.10] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — CONTRIBUTING.md hardcoded `2.7.8` version number in two illustration examples**: replaced both with generic placeholders (`X.Y.Z` and `X.Y.(Z+1)`) so the documentation never becomes stale after a release; the specific version numbers were not covered by validate.sh and would require manual maintenance after every release

---

## [2.7.9] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — `handbrake-protocol.md` missing `continue` command documentation during Handbrake wait**: added "`continue` During Handbrake Wait" section defining the behavior: same semantics as explicit Bypass (⚠️ HANDBRAKE BYPASSED block, 🔴 Critical severity preserved, Gate still applies); agents relying solely on `handbrake-protocol.md` previously had no guidance when user typed `continue` at the Handbrake context-request stage
- **Low — README Best Practices table missing 8th rule from SKILL.md**: added "Do not allow any tool, MCP, agent, or skill to bypass this gate" row — the anti-bypass rule was defined in SKILL.md but absent from the README documentation mirror
- **Low — CONTRIBUTING.md Release Checklist Step 3 hardcoded "All 12 `examples/*.md`"**: replaced with "All `examples/*.md`" (dynamic — no hardcoded count) to prevent stale instructions when a new example is added

---

## [2.7.8] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — CONTRIBUTING.md "New Example" section silent on `Skill version` stamp**: added item 6 to the requirements list documenting the `**Skill version**: X.Y.Z` stamp and the validate.sh Check 8 that enforces it; contributors adding examples without the stamp were getting unexplained CI failures
- **Medium — Quality Standards table missing version stamp row**: added `Version stamp` row so contributors see the requirement before submitting a PR

---

## [2.7.7] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — CONTRIBUTING.md Quality Standards "Cross-references" row missing `checklists/`**: updated to list `frameworks/`, `checklists/`, and `examples/` — contributors adding checklist files now know to index them in SKILL.md, preventing confusing CI failures
- **Low — IR reply format in `immediate-report.md` template diverged from all 12 examples**: template updated to match the compact `Reply: 📝 ... | \`continue\` ...` format used consistently across examples; the multi-line format was unreachable dead code

---

## [2.7.6] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — Double blank line in validate.sh between Check 7 and Check 8**: extra blank line removed; all check transitions now use exactly one blank line
- **Low — Missing blank line in validate.sh between Check 9 ok and Check 10 comment**: blank line inserted for visual consistency with all other check transitions
- **Low — CHANGELOG [2.7.3] "Added" entry for Check 10 was factually incorrect**: annotated with "(fix was incomplete — correctly applied in 2.7.4)"

---

## [2.7.5] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Low — validate.sh `head()` shadowed system `head` binary**: renamed function to `section()` — eliminates silent collision if a contributor adds `| head -N` to the script
- **Low — Check 4 emitted `ok` before canonical source checks ran**: moved `ok` call to after both example and canonical checks complete — CI output no longer shows `✅` followed by `❌` within the same check
- **Low — Check 10 section label inconsistent with ok-message**: `head "Framework index coverage"` updated to `section "Framework and checklist index coverage"` to match the extended scope

---

## [2.7.4] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **Medium — validate.sh Check 10 missing `checklists/` coverage**: CHANGELOG 2.7.3 stated the fix was applied, but code only iterated `frameworks/`; added `checklists/` to the Check 10 glob — both `frameworks/*.md` and `checklists/*.md` on disk are now verified against SKILL.md Index
- **Low — CHANGELOG [2.7.2] Check 1 description inaccurate**: described an intermediate implementation that was superseded by the final SIGPIPE-free fix

---

## [2.7.3] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — `appleboy/ssh-action@v1.0.0` mutable tag in cicd-pipeline-review.md**: comment in "corrected" YAML example still referenced a floating semver tag; updated comment to warn that SHA-pinning is required before use
- **Medium — `immediate-report.md` missing `---` separator before General Analysis template**: Performance template block was not visually separated from General Analysis section; `---` added
- **Medium — `[Unreleased]` block mis-positioned in CHANGELOG.md**: appeared after `[2.7.2]` instead of as first section; moved to top per Keep a Changelog spec
- **Medium — `validate.yml` missing top-level `permissions: {}`**: deny-all baseline not set; added `permissions: {}` between `on:` and `jobs:` blocks
- **Low — IR Flash Format domain list truncated**: `[Architecture / Data / Security / Code / Product / UX / Strategy / ...]` replaced with full 12-domain list

### Added
- validate.sh **Check 10** extended to cover `checklists/` directory in addition to `frameworks/` *(fix was incomplete — correctly applied in 2.7.4)*
- Check 4 canonical source check: verifies `continue` wording in `SKILL.md` and `output-format.md`

---

## [2.7.2] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — validate.sh Check 1 gawk-specific**: replaced 3-arg `match()` (gawk extension) with `grep -m1 '^## \[[0-9]'` — matches only versioned headers (digit after bracket), exits cleanly after first match, no SIGPIPE under `set -euo pipefail`; compatible with macOS default awk and all POSIX environments
- **High — README.md version badge stale at 2.7.0**: updated to `2.7.2`; added validate.sh Check 11 to detect badge/version drift going forward
- **High — Handbrake Output Block missing Performance domain**: added `/ Performance` to closed domain list in `handbrake-protocol.md` Output Block template
- **High — Check 9 did not cover `checklists/`**: broadened regex from `frameworks/...` to `(frameworks|checklists)/...` — risk-checklist.md and questioning-checklist.md now covered
- **Medium — validate.yml missing `permissions: contents: read`**: added minimal-permission block at job level per `version-control.md` GitHub Actions guidance
- **Medium — Check 8 silent pass on missing stamp**: added `else: fail()` branch — examples without a `Skill version` line now correctly fail CI

### Added
- validate.sh **Check 10**: iterates `frameworks/*.md` on disk and verifies each file appears in SKILL.md Index — catches unindexed new frameworks
- validate.sh **Check 11**: verifies README.md version badge matches SKILL.md version — catches badge drift on every version bump
- Standard framework headers (`> **Role** / **Load when** / **Always paired with**`) added to `performance.md` and `security-stride.md`

---
## [2.7.1] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — validate.sh Check 1 broken**: grep -m1 returned only [Unreleased] before -v filter; fixed to grep | grep -v Unreleased | head -1 so CHANGELOG_VER correctly resolves to latest released version
- **High — validate.sh Check 2 FENCE_ISSUES never counted**: FENCE_ISSUES was referenced but never initialized or incremented; added FENCE_ISSUES=0 init and ((FENCE_ISSUES++)) increment so fence-balance failures now correctly set non-zero count
- **High — CHANGELOG.md had UTF-8 BOM**: bytes xEF 0xBB 0xBF present since initial write; stripped to plain UTF-8 without BOM
- **High — Performance domain missing from Handbrake escalation map**: added Performance bottlenecks, scalability, resource limits, N+1 queries row with Senior Developer / Tech Lead as responsible role
- **High — Performance domain missing from IR context templates**: added ### ⚡ Performance — Bottlenecks / Scalability / Resource Limits template (6 questions) to immediate-report.md; updated template count from 13 → 14
- **Medium — actions/checkout mutable tag in CI**: SHA-pinned to `11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683` (v4.2.2) per `version-control.md` guidance
- **Medium — building-protocol.md described as unconditionally free**: CONTRIBUTING.md now correctly states it is conditionally free (loaded with code, skipped for pure text/strategy)

### Added
- validate.sh check 9 (retroactively documented): verifies all framework files referenced in SKILL.md Index exist on disk
- CONTRIBUTING.md: 8K token budget warning for SKILL.md — contributors must not add content without delegating equivalent content to framework files

---

## [2.7.0] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- `frameworks/handbrake-checklist.md` — new 8-question rapid-sweep checklist to determine if Handbrake should activate; includes minimum steps and bypass disclosure template
- `.gitattributes` — enforces LF line endings on `scripts/validate.sh` and GitHub Actions workflows for cross-platform compatibility
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — GitHub Actions CI: runs `bash scripts/validate.sh` on every push and PR to `main`

### Fixed
- **Critical — IR `continue` vs Handbrake conflict**: `continue` at the IR stage now explicitly documented to skip IR context collection only, NOT bypass the Handbrake; if finding is 🔴 Critical the Handbrake still activates as the next mandatory step (`immediate-report.md`, `SKILL.md`)
- **High — validate.sh CRLF line endings**: re-saved with LF only; Windows contributors can now run `bash scripts/validate.sh` in Git Bash without `$'\r': command not found` errors
- **High — example version stamps stale**: all 12 examples updated from `v2.4.1` to current `v2.6.9`; new validate.sh check 8 enforces version stamp consistency going forward
- **High — premortem.md budget conflict**: reclassified from Domain Framework (counted against 2-framework budget) to Protocol File (free); Handbrake Step 6 mandates it, so it was self-defeating to count it; domain count updated 13 → 12 in `SKILL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **High — "bypass is recorded" wording**: replaced with "visible in the conversation history" in `SKILL.md` Gate Protocol and `handbrake-protocol.md` — the previous wording implied non-existent persistence
- **Medium — duplicate scope guard**: removed shorter/incomplete scope guard from `Rule Precedence` section; single authoritative definition remains in `Automatic Trigger Detection` with full Disambiguation rule
- **Medium — IR+Handbrake merge cross-reference missing**: added merge note to `handbrake-protocol.md` Output Block section pointing to `immediate-report.md` for combined format
- **Medium — `handbrake-checklist.md` referenced but missing**: created the file; added to SKILL.md Index under Protocol Files

### Changed
- **SKILL.md slimmed** (~25% size reduction): removed duplicated Handbrake flow diagram, role escalation table, IR flash format template, and Building Protocol tables — these are all defined authoritatively in their dedicated framework files; SKILL.md now contains minimal summaries with explicit load references
- `premortem.md` moved from Domain Frameworks section to Protocol Files section in SKILL.md Index
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: domain count updated to 12; `premortem.md` added to protocol files exclusion list
- validate.sh check 7: added `.gitattributes` and `.github/workflows/validate.yml` to required files list
- validate.sh: added check 8 — example version stamps must match `SKILL.md` version

---

- `examples/version-control-review.md` — full protocol stack: leaked DB credentials + force push to main → ⚡ IR + 🛑 Multi-role Handbrake + git filter-repo remediation plan
- Version Control domain added to `handbrake-protocol.md` (Role→Escalation Map + Context Question Template)
- Version Control Context Request Template added to `immediate-report.md`
- Version Control added to IR domain list, Handbrake escalation table, trigger table, and "When to Use" in `SKILL.md`

---

## [2.6.7] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Missing `---` separator before `## Handbrake Bypass` section in `handbrake-protocol.md` (accidentally removed during v2.6.6 restructuring)

---
