## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- `postmortem-writing` companion skill for post-incident analysis

---
## [2.7.1] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- **High — validate.sh Check 1 broken**: grep -m1 returned only [Unreleased] before -v filter; fixed to grep | grep -v Unreleased | head -1 so CHANGELOG_VER correctly resolves to latest released version
- **High — validate.sh Check 2 FENCE_ISSUES never counted**: FENCE_ISSUES was referenced but never initialized or incremented; added FENCE_ISSUES=0 init and ((FENCE_ISSUES++)) increment so fence-balance failures now correctly set non-zero count
- **High — CHANGELOG.md had UTF-8 BOM**: bytes xEF 0xBB 0xBF present since initial write; stripped to plain UTF-8 without BOM
- **High — Performance domain missing from Handbrake escalation map**: added Performance bottlenecks, scalability, resource limits, N+1 queries row with Senior Developer / Tech Lead as responsible role
- **High — Performance domain missing from IR context templates**: added ### ⚡ Performance — Bottlenecks / Scalability / Resource Limits template (6 questions) to immediate-report.md; updated template count from 13 → 14
- **Medium — actions/checkout mutable tag in CI**: SHA-pinned to 11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683 (v4.2.2) per ersion-control.md guidance
- **Medium — building-protocol.md described as unconditionally free**: CONTRIBUTING.md now correctly states it is conditionally free (loaded with code, skipped for pure text/strategy)

### Added
- validate.sh check 9 (retroactively documented): verifies all framework files referenced in SKILL.md Index exist on disk
- CONTRIBUTING.md: 8K token budget warning for SKILL.md — contributors must not add content without delegating equivalent content to framework files

---


## [2.7.0] — 2026-02-20

### Added
- `frameworks/handbrake-checklist.md` — new 8-question rapid-sweep checklist to determine if Handbrake should activate; includes minimum steps and bypass disclosure template
- `.gitattributes` — enforces LF line endings on `scripts/validate.sh` and GitHub Actions workflows for cross-platform compatibility
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml` — GitHub Actions CI: runs `bash scripts/validate.sh` on every push and PR to `main`

### Fixed
- **Critical — IR `continue` vs Handbrake conflict**: `continue` at the IR stage now explicitly documented to skip IR context collection only, NOT bypass the Handbrake; if finding is 🔴 Critical the Handbrake still activates as the next mandatory step (`immediate-report.md`, `SKILL.md`)
- **High — validate.sh CRLF line endings**: re-saved with LF only; Windows contributors can now run `bash scripts/validate.sh` in Git Bash without `$'\r': command not found` errors
- **High — example version stamps stale**: all 12 examples updated from `v2.4.1` to current `v2.6.9`; new validate.sh check 8 enforces version stamp consistency going forward
- **High — premortem.md budget conflict**: reclassified from Domain Framework (counted against 2-framework budget) to Protocol File (free); Handbrake Step 6 mandates it, so it was self-defeating to count it; domain count updated 13 → 12 in `SKILL.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- **High — "bypass is recorded" wording**: replaced with "visible in the conversation history" in `SKILL.md` Gate Protocol and `handbrake-protocol.md` — the previous wording implied non-existent persistence
- **Medium — duplicate scope guard**: removed shorter/incomplete scope guard from `Rule Precedence` section; single authoritative definition remains in `Automatic Trigger Detection` with full Disambiguation rule
- **Medium — IR+Handbrake merge cross-reference missing**: added merge note to `handbrake-protocol.md` Output Block section pointing to `immediate-report.md` for combined format
- **Medium — `handbrake-checklist.md` referenced but missing**: created the file; added to SKILL.md Index under Protocol Files

### Changed
- **SKILL.md slimmed** (~25% size reduction): removed duplicated Handbrake flow diagram, role escalation table, IR flash format template, and Building Protocol tables — these are all defined authoritatively in their dedicated framework files; SKILL.md now contains minimal summaries with explicit load references
- `premortem.md` moved from Domain Frameworks section to Protocol Files section in SKILL.md Index
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: domain count updated to 12; `premortem.md` added to protocol files exclusion list
- validate.sh check 7: added `.gitattributes` and `.github/workflows/validate.yml` to required files list
- validate.sh: added check 8 — example version stamps must match `SKILL.md` version

---

- `examples/version-control-review.md` — full protocol stack: leaked DB credentials + force push to main → ⚡ IR + 🛑 Multi-role Handbrake + git filter-repo remediation plan
- Version Control domain added to `handbrake-protocol.md` (Role→Escalation Map + Context Question Template)
- Version Control Context Request Template added to `immediate-report.md`
- Version Control added to IR domain list, Handbrake escalation table, trigger table, and "When to Use" in `SKILL.md`

---

## [2.6.7] — 2026-02-20

### Fixed
- Missing `---` separator before `## Handbrake Bypass` section in `handbrake-protocol.md` (accidentally removed during v2.6.6 restructuring)

### Fixed
